debt convexity analytic	"The second derivative of a security's price with respect to its yield, divided by the security's price. A security exhibits positive convexity when its price rises more for a downward move in its yield than its price declines for an equal upward move in its yield. Further notes: A measure of the change in price for a given change in Modified Duration. This always (necessarily) refers to Modified Duration. This is used as another risk measurement. Numerator is always (a) duration - either MacCaulays or Modified. Always rate of change of (one of the) Duration against some other parameter. The other paramater can be characterised as a Yield (it may be the Price, but that has a relationship to the Yield in any case). REVIEW: Inconsistency in the above - is it always necessarily Modified Duration that is referred to, or \"any\" Duration measure (Macaulays and.or Modified)? notes 9 Dec A measure of the sensitivity of the price with reference to interest rates. This is normally determined with reference to maturity, but since there are different maturity dates, this figure gives an estimate of the equitvalent if you had a homogenous portfolio, i.e. this is an estimate based on a pure equivalent, homogenous portfolio. Convexity of instrument versus portfolio. Sees instrument in terms of the set of cashflows. The term Convexity can be applied either to a bond or to a portfolio. More notes: When you get Convexit in MD, it will tell you what Duration it is refrfering to, along with Redemption Date (logically). Also if there is Option Adjusted Yield, there is a third set of analytics. What are they? i.e. OA Convexity, Duration Yield and the rest. Conclusions: Agreed to revisit this in OTC."	rel:definition	1

lender right	"Rights on the lender to protect them against loss. furthe rNtoes: Logically, considering the two parties, they both have protecxtion mechanisms. so while the lender has protecxtion mechanisms through mortgage insurance, and the consumer has protextion mechanisms such as good faith estimates. also the agencies (see Consumer Protection Agency), an instance of which is the CFPB in the US (just set up). Lender rights are: - expressed in the Contract Consumer protection develops becaues the contract is written by the potential Lender. So the rights are introcued to rectify the imbalance between the two parties. Same goes for insurance. consumer protection laws (governe dby the relevant consumer protection agency. So the lender protexts itself as it writes th contract AND does the things it needs to do to protext itself, but on the approval process, and with later instruments such as insurance. Interestingly., it is the Borrower who pays for this by paying for credit reports etc. So the borrower protects itself by other mechanisms. Caveat emptor - displaced by regulation (the buyer is protected by regulation). Uberimae Fidae - in the utmost good faith. Mortgage Insurance is an additional means of mitigating the risk, that the lended may have., so if the information assessed is not accurate, or if the borrower's situation changes for the worse. then the risk rating may go down. So the Mortgage Insurance is a further strategy which mitigates any shortfall in the Lender Righrs that you may have - ie someone guarantees. In the US you can also avoid that by having paid a deposit. PIMI: Principal, Interst and Morgage Insurance. So the Borrower pays towards the MI, esxcept if they have paid a given amount as deposit. there are 2 types of MI: 1. protects the lender in the event of borrower degault 2. Insurance for \"Incapacity to pay the mortage\" (these can be bought off the shelf - can combine health, unemployment etc.). - this is the Borrower mitigating their own risk. Prevents foreclosure. Similar to general sickness etc. Where the lender charges for MI, the cost is passed onto the Borrower. e.g. if there is a % valuation (e.g. 70% in Aus, 80% in US for example) then no insurance is required."	rel:definition	1

dutch auction	"The party to which the offer is made need not be the holder. Details: Question on \"Who is the actor?\" Dutch auction would have multiple parties? What is the scenario? Usually happens when a company is about to go into administration. Looking at the scneario descried in the SWIFT definition - not clear if this is the only such scenario. Possibly the issuer has to notif ythe shareholders that the offer is being made. The offer is made by the third party but the notice is sent by the issuer (via their agent) and via the registrar who holds the details of who holds all the shares. Example: Lloyds banking group - most shares would be owned by the market, and a small percentage might be held by private investors. So in this scenario everyone has to be given the opportunity to sell at the given price. so the CAE message is still issued by the Issuer. SWIFT detailed names (synonym?) \"Dutch Auction, Bid Tender\""	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1
dutch auction	"Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is an action by a party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. UPDATE THIS DEFINITION: Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is the result of an action by a third party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited (and given a message by the issuer) to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. OR It might also represent a separate scenario where third parties do this, as per the original SWIFT defition. You can only go to the Registrar which would the other scenario impossible. Agents and Registrars: The issue issuer os the company which issued the shares (as modeled); Most companies don't interact directly with the market to find out who they need to disseminate the info to. They can, but more likely the employ \"Issuers Agent\". That provides one point of contact from the organization. That agent handles all coms with the Registrars, and to the news wires etc., to disseminate the corporate action. Context: CAE only, or in the context of the Issue? When you issue the security you nominate an Agent, in the prospectus, there is specified an Issuing Agent. This is the one that does these things. Usually a merchant bank etc. in the old days. This is who will have directly facilitated that direct market engagement. Next question: This is part of going public, so these agents are appointed as part of going public."	rel:definition	1

strip	"Full definition and notes from Morningstar: STRIPS are debt securities that are created through the process of coupon stripping. They are essentially traditional Treasury bonds, except that the bond's principal (its corpus) has been separated--stripped--from its interest (its coupon). Investors may then choose to purchase securities based on either the principal or interest of the bond. STRIPS take the form of zero-coupon securities. That is, they make no periodic interest payments, as most bonds do. Instead, you buy them at a deep discount from their face value, which is the amount you receive when they mature."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

In other words, the amount in your margin account changes daily as the market fluctuates in relation to your futures contract.

otc interest rate cap option contract	"Definition and editorial note against the property 'strike effect' for this class (property is now a restriction): The Strike rate is to be subtracted from the Observable rate on the reset date, to determine the settlement amount. REVIEW SESSION NOTES: This is incorrect. Cap applies to borrower. the Cap is the max amount I will pay to borrow. I take a capped rate. I am the buyer of the option. The market rate this time is higher than the capped rate. You as the seller of the option will pay me thedifference bwteen the capped rate and the market reate. If the market rate is lower than the capped rate no one pays anything because I will not exercise my right to that capped rate. So no money changes hands at settlement. Then: capped Loan: What I would be paying would be interest at the market rate if the market rate is lower, but if the market rate is higher then I would pay interest at the capped rate. This is the difference between a cap as a loan or as a cash settled thing. These represent different kinds of contract: Non loan one: Cap talks of settlement being difference between the market rate and the strike rate. This is cash settled. Name: \"Cap\" Loan one: Cap talks about a maximum interest rate payable by the holder, so the holder pays an amount each time, up to a maximum which is the Cap rate.

Debt that is defined by a convertible bond are redeemed by conversion into an equity security issued by the same company. More notes from the EDMC SME Review: Distinction between call and amortizing is whether you pay off everybody at the same time or via a lottery. SF can be either. either amortize the payment of a SF or pay it off by a lottery. The terms of the instrument determine that. Mandatory - all in the schedule. Mandatory to the bond issuer.

date determination reference rule	"These kinds of rules are referred to in two separate FpML enumerations, the \"BusinessDayConventionEnum\" for determining when a returned date is rolled to a suitable business day, and one for scheduled event dates (called, confusingly \"Roll\" dates) as defined in \"RollConventionEnum\". One such rule appears in both. Also included in this set of rules is the optional rule for further modifying the date returned by a date roll rule. In FpML description for \"BusinessDayConventionEnum\": \"The convention for adjusting any relevant date if it would otherwise fall on a day that is not a valid business day. Note that FRN is included here as a type of business day convention although it does not strictly fall within ISDA's definition of a Business Day Convention and does not conform to the simple definition given above.\" These rules (with the possible exception of \"FRN\") are applied to dates returned by some date specification or parametric schedule specification or some other such rule, and detail treatment of those returned dates in the event of them being for example a working day, being in the wrong month or year and so on. The Date Roll Rule operates on the date returned by the date specification or parametric schedule, and return a further date. If the Date Roll Rule is used alone, that is the final date to be returned from the entire specification or parametric schedule, as the date on which the scheduled event is to take place. In the case of the Modify Convention Roll Rule, this rule is applied to the date returned by the Date Roll Rule, and returns a date which is itself the event date for the scheduled event."	rel:editorialNote	1

quantitative amount	"Later internal review: This term is currently ancestral to terms with both meanings - an actual amount of some kind of thing, such as an amount of money; and the measure which is the amount of some quantity of things, e.g. an amount specified in a contract as \"this much\" of something. We should probably clean this up. Until we do, this term is ancestral to both types of amount term. So for instance it is not incorrect to talk about some amount of something, and have a datatype for a term within that, which is a Monetary Amount (for example, Monetary Amount as part of some specification of a Retained Amount in a loan contract). . This will probably flag up as inconsistent and need fixing later."	rel:editorialNote	1

future instrument	"Agreement to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity, a currency or a financial instrument at a particular price on a stipulated future date. A futures contract obligates the buyer to purchase the underlying commodity, currency or financial instrument and the seller to sell it unless the contract is sold to another before settlement date which may happen if a trader waits to take a profit or cut a loss. Further notes: This contrasts with options trading in which the option buyer may choose whether or not to exercise the option by the exercise date. Unlike options, futures convey an obligation to buy. The risk to the holder is unlimited, and because the payoff pattern is symmetrical, the risk to the seller is unlimited as well. Dollars lost and gained by each party on a futures contract are equal and opposite. In other words, futures trading is a zero-sum game. Futures contracts are forward contracts, meaning they represent a pledge to make a certain transaction at a future date. The exchange of assets occurs on the date specified in the contract. Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, trade on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by clearinghouses. Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily. Finally, by making an offsetting trade, taking delivery of goods, or arranging for an exchange of goods, futures contracts can be closed. Hedgers often trade futures for the purpose of keeping price risk in check. Definition origin: Barrons, adapted by EDMC SMER."	rel:definition	1

floating rate note date rule	"FpML definition: \"Per 2000 ISDA Definitions, Section 4.11, FRN Convention, Eurodollar Convention.\" The above definition is from FpML and does not give the meaning or nature of this rule. FpML notes that this is not strictly a Date Roll Rule (but it may be selected in place of one). On inspection of the ISDA 2000 definition text, this may be because the FRN rule contains within it a specification of the Modified Following date roll rule (Date following rule modified by Modification rule). This rule appears in FpML both in the BusinessDayConventionEnum and the RollConventionEnum (for date roll rules and for scheduled event dates respectively). From FpML definition for BusinessDayConventionEnum: \"... Note that FRN is included here as a type of business day convention although it does not strictly fall within ISDA's definition of a Business Day Convention and does not conform to the simple definition given above.\" Note that this FRN rule is also included in the FpML enumeration for \"RollConventionEnum\". This is the enumeration of possible Calculation Period End Dates and uses the word \"Roll\" in a completely different sense (the date that the application of some calculation to some amount is rolled over from one rate to the next). Full definition from ISDA 2000 Section 4.11: Section 4.11. FRN Convention; Eurodollar Convention. \"FRN Convention\" or \"Eurodollar Convention\" means, in respect of either Payment Dates or Period End Dates for a Swap Transaction and a party, that the Payment Dates or Period End Dates of that party will be each day during the Term of the Swap Transaction that numerically corresponds to the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party in the calendar month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date occurred (or, in the case of the first applicable Payment Date or the Period End Date, the day that numerically corresponds to the Effective Date in the calendar month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the Effective Date occurred), except that (a) if there is not any such numerically corresponding day in the calendar month in which a Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party should occur, then the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the last day that is a Business Day in that month, (b) if a Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of the party would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, then the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the first following day that is a Business Day unless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the first preceding day that is a Business Day and (c) if the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party occurred on the last day in a calendar month that was a Business Day, then all subsequent applicable Payment Dates or Period End Dates, as the case may be, of that party prior to the Termination Date will be the last day that is a Business Day in the month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date occurred."	rel:editorialNote	1

central counterparty clearing house	"These clearing houses are often operated by the major banks in the country. The house's prime responsibility is to provide efficiency and stability to the financial markets that they operate in.\n\nThere are two main processes that are carried out by CCPs: clearing and settlement of market transactions. Clearing relates to identifying the obligations of both parties on either side of a transaction. Settlement occurs when the final transfer of securities and funds occur.\n\nCCPs benefit both parties in a transaction because they bear most of the credit risk. If two individuals deal with one another, the buyer bears the credit risk of the seller, and vice versa. When a CCP is used the credit risk that is held against both buyer and seller is coming from the CCP, which in all likelihood is much less than in the previous situation."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

syndicated loan participation note	"FpML has \"Syndicated Loan\". Assume this is the same thing. Review session notes (pre-OTC SMER): [From: Investopedia: Loan Participation Note] Review: 1. Add terms e.g. contractual terms for participation 2. Are there other types of Participation Note which allow for participation in other forms of Asset / Collateral? 3. Can these be traded or not? Definition suggests a bilateral contract. 14 July: The note is documentation. That is, this is evidence for the securirty. An underwriting document (?) is similar. Someone promises to issue the notes for you. This is similar to how debt securities begin life - the underwriter sets the limits on what you will pay fo rthe ssecurity, and of course the amount. Two step orocess of creating the security and then selling it. See Bond / Debt Issuance diagrams and models. (see diagram notes etc. here) Note = tradeability. Indicates that someone has made a commitment at large. Loan Participation Note is either the other end of the loan, or a way of participating in the loan facility. If the latter, it would be a way of documenting the loan facility in a way that you can freely trade it. The alternative (non LPN) would be different. Circles - trading groups - members of the circle. Have to tell the other members of the circle what's going on, and get their permission from the members of that circle before you can assign those rights to someone else. This would mark out the OTC variant of these things. Then: risk participany, who has no original participation, but (later) agrees to take all of your risk off you. So now we have something with a secondary market and something without. Which is which, and what are they called? Which is the one described in FpML (presumably OTC). Generally, if you document your commitment to lend money, then other members of hte syndicate also have a risk in that you might not stump up your obligations. This has implicatiojns for being able to make this a security. This differs from a bond, where there is no intervening credit facility, you just buyt the thing that way you have become the lender. So there remain some doubts about how a participation note works. There is an element of credit embedded against the purchaser of any such note that gave someone membership ofa syndicate. There are also two sets of words in play: - Syndicated Loan - Loan Participation Note. So one of these probably gives you membership of the syndicate, and the other just gives you participation in the loan. It is less likely that there is a secondary market in the note that gives you participationm in a syndicate (because of the credit risk) but in theory at least, it is possible to create an instrument for this. We just don't know if it exists."	rel:editorialNote	1

option premium payment arrangement	"This was originally a selectable list called option premium type selection (option premium type in data models). Note against that element is given below, based on which this has been implemented as two sets of classes (both characterized as kinds of method). \n\nEarlier SME Review note:\nFurther notes: REVIEW THIS - there appear to be two separate semantics in this list; are they mutually exclusive? Answers: You can pay the premium up front or in arrears (pre v pos tpaid) or you can pay it at any agreed time (indeed the time is already defined as terms see Payment Date), so this simply reflects that. Then there are other types of \"Participating OptionS\" where the anmount you pay depends on something else - so you don't pay the Premium up front. If it ends up outt of the money then you don't have to pay as much. So this is \"Variable\" premium. The alternative to this is \"Fixed\". If it's prepaid it's firxed If it's post paid it can bt variable or fixed. SO these are two facts. FpML: Premium Type for Forward Start Equity Option"	rel:editorialNote	1

capitalization issue	"A general kind of issue which increases the capital base of the company. Other kinds of issue: Like a Bonus Issue except that it would increase the capital. There could be several events which could be considered as Capitalization Issues. 25 May Later research: Scrip or Bonus issue is seen to be synonymous with this but more accurate. However, we question this - if you have the chance to purchase shares at a particular price (which is a right) would extend the definition of .. 20 July: this could have a broader meaning than Capital reserves Distribution It would include distribution of capital and trying to raise capital by additional capital injection Example: If the company issues bonds, that also changes the capital base. Now to change the capital base, there are two directions, up or down. Bonus issue falls into the above because you are increasing the capital base. A rights issue also increateses the capital base. Distributions of capital has the opposite effect. Paying out cash to reduce those items that are in your reserves. the reserves are greater than you need so you pay out cash on those. Labeling: capitalization implies the creation of capital so only suggests an increase the capital base"	rel:definition	1

draft	"A draft is a legally binding order by one party (the drawer) to a second party (the drawee) to make payment to a third party (the payee). A simple example is a bank check -which is simply an order directing a bank to pay a third party. The three parties don't have to be distinct. For example, someone might write himself a check as a simple means of transferring funds from one bank account to another. In this case, the drawer and payee are the same person. When a draft guarantees payment for goods in international trade, it is called a bill of exchange. A draft can require immediate payment by the second party to the third upon presentation of the draft. This is called a sight draft. Checks are sight drafts. In trade, drafts often are for deferred payment. An importer might write a draft promising payment to an exporter for delivery of goods with payment to occur 60 days after the goods are delivered. Such drafts are called time drafts. They are said to mature on the payment date. In this example, the importer is both the drawer and the drawee. Definition source: riskglossary.com"	rel:definition	1

lead manager	"This is the party which determines which potential lender (syndicate member) is going to lend which amount. When interest is paid this party applies the payments to the different lenders. Meanwhile the note is the means to trade this - it is an asset whic evidences the obligation to pay someone (the holder of this particular document). Hence there is a secondary market in the Note, that is the piece of paper, which is the asset. If you sell the note, do you cease to be a syndicate member and the holder becomes one instead? No, syndicate membership is specific to the primary, creation of the instrument, in the same way as a bond issue takes place. What we don't know: whether the participation is freely negotiable, or has limited negotiability. What we think is that as a minimum it gives you rights to the interest and principal, but does not bring you into the facility as a whole. there are (separately) structures which allow you to buy ito the syndicate. These are called \"Pariticipations\". This would (presumably) give you access into new loans. For this piece of paper, if you are the holder of the note you would be part of the syndicate. We need additional clarificaiton on how syndicates work."	rel:editorialNote	1

construction loan credit facility tranche	"A loan taken out for construction purposes. Further notes: These are a temporary loan. when the construction is finished then that loan is transformed to another loan, which would be a permanent loan. Information to follow on what the new permanent loan would be. Terms are adjusted in the new loan, since in construction loans the rates are significantly higher. This is an incentive to complete the construction works. Notes from PoC reviews, discussing Maximum Balance concept: In a Construction Loan you agree a maximum amount that you could draw. As you progress with the construction you continue to draw more and more. So you start with the minimum. Example: for purpose of construction of a house you could need to borrow up to 500K and the bank establishes the milestones at which certain amounts are made availalbe and can be drawn. For instance prior to start you might draw 10%, (50K); the next 50K would be available to draw only once the foundations are laid. And so on. Milestones may include \"Frame standing\" (for American-style frame based houses). Each stage requires inspection on behalf of the bank. So you are starting with no more than 10% (in this example) of what is allowable, and could arrive to the full 500K by the end of ths construction but it is not mandated that you arrive to that. What differentiates a Construction Loan is that there si a max amount specified and there are Milestones specified in which the amounts for each milestone can be advanced."	rel:definition	1

producer price index	"Statistical agencies implement the Laspeyres index by putting it into price-relative (price change from the base period) and revenue-share (from the base period) format. In this form, the Laspeyres index can be written as the sum of base-period revenue shares of the items in the index times their corresponding price relatives. Statistical agency practice has introduced some approximations to the theoretical Laspeyres target due to a number of practical problems with producing the Laspeyres index exactly. For these and other pragmatic reasons, some agencies use alternatives depending on circumstances. See the IMF publication cited for a full explanation of the most commonly used approaches and trade-offs made for determining PPI."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

producer price index	"The standard methodology for a typical PPI is based on a Laspeyres price index with fixed quantities from an earlier base period. The construction of this index can be thought of in terms of selecting a basket of goods and services representative of base-period revenues, valuing this at base-period prices, and then repricing the same basket at current-period prices. The target PPI in this case is defined to be the ratio of these two revenues. Practicing statisticians use this methodology because it has at least three practical advantages. It is easily explained to the public, it can use often expensive and untimely weighting information from the date of the last (or an even earlier) survey or administrative source (rather than requiring sources of data for the current month), and it need not be revised if users accept the Laspeyres premise."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

national identification number	"A national identification number, national identity number, or national insurance number is used by the governments of many countries as a means of tracking their citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents for the purposes of work, taxation, government benefits, health care, and other governmentally-related functions. The number will appear on an identity document issued by a country.\n\nThe ways in which such a system is implemented are dependent on the country, but in most cases, a citizen is issued an identification number at birth or when they reach a legal age (typically the age of 18). Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.\n\nMany countries issued such numbers ostensibly for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States originally developed its Social Security number system as a means of disbursing Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become utilized for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

Also some of the parameters used in this model would presumably make reference to standard mathematical model constructs such as normal distribution, variaous deviation measures, Chi squared and so on. These are not presently in the semantics model, but can be modeled semantically if required.

loan borrower commitment	loan borrower	rel:acceptedBy	1
loan borrower commitment	"This is in the sense of a commitment as defined in a Contract. The Loan Contract between Lender and Borrower(s) would define these commitments. Includes commitments to pay principal, commitment to pay interest, and other covenants or conditions agreed upon. There is also a status of a commitment prior to the loan, in relation to the credit facility. This is not the same as what is modeled here, where I now have it as a parent of the legal commitments made by the borrower when they sign the loan. On the above, see also \"Loan Precedent Conditions\" which covers the conditions to be met before the loan may be initiated (approved). PoC Review comment: Not needed in data model. Renamed from \"Loan Borrower Association\" in logical model. PoC Review comments on original term (renamed and re-interpreted since): This should just be Loan borrower, i.e. it defines which borrower is associated with each loan. It represents the commitment of this borrower to be a borrower and to repay this loan. IBM Notes: Unique identifier per borrower (not showing the real name) - to enable borrowers with multiple loans in the pool to be identified (e.g. further advances / second liens are shown as separate entries). Should not change over the life of the transaction By storing this identifier in the loan Borrower commitment a separate value is available for each loan borrower Modeling Note: The original PoC SDM term described above fulfilled the dual role of being an intermediate table between borrower and loan, and have the name and meaning of \"Commitment\". The Semantic Model defines commitments already (e.g. for transaction models), and so we have chosen to model the commitments of the borrower in terms of their relationship to the contract and terms for interest and principal, which would need to be modeled anyway. The PoC notes above are of little relevance to the semantics of this term."	rel:editorialNote	1

Fifty percent and over stockholding gives power to fire a director and force out minority stockholders by acquiring their shares as per the rules of the firm. Holder of 75 percent of the stock has the power to change the articles and memorandum of association and the firms name, reduce the share capital, allow the firm to buy its own shares from other stockholders, and to shut down the business.

geometric mean	"The geometric mean is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers. A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single 'figure of merit' for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful 'average' to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5)."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

spot contract	"A contract relating to a transaction which is for immediate settlement. Further notes: A spot transaction simply means a transaction in which some goods or currency are exchanged for some other goods or currency, with no future delivery provision. A Spot contract is the usually unwritten contract which by definition underlies that kind of transaction. Spot means for immediate settlement. Immediate here means the minimum number of days that are possible. This includes general retail transactions as well as the specialixed types of spot transactiojn foud in the financial services and treasury trading contexts, such as Fx Spots (a sub type of this) and commodity spot transactions. However the settlement date is still some time in the future. Also given different time zones, the settlement would be at some time in the future anyway Formerly a financial e.g. currency Spot would have been 2 (working) days settlement for example. Canadian v USD would be 1 day. Follows a settlement convention from the relevant market. Action: Add reference to Settlement Convention for the given market."	rel:definition	1

Most CAE will change the market perception. Not all actions which change the market perception are Corporate Events. Suggestion A corporate action is a generic class not actually homogenous, one of whcih si the Corporate Action of providin information to the market. There are legal requirements in most jurisdicitons saying that companies must advise their shareholders or bondhoders, about things whic might change the price. A separate kind of event notifies holders of securities (shares or bonds) of events which require an aciton on the part of the older (mandatory or bvoluntart) of the holder of the share. Then there are a set of events that don't get classified as CAE but have been included by SWIFT which are the actions by the holder, which would impact the issuer. These include calls on rights.

price yield spread specification	"In Debt pricing, Spreads are used because it's easier to quote things in a stable way, and it reflects the relative value of the thing. This is a spread of yields between the instrument so priced and the reference instrument. This spread is the mechanism by which the price is determined in yield terms, as the annualised interest rate that a investor requires for an investment. A yield is expressed as the annualised interest Rate that a investor requires for an investment. In the case of a loan the terms are set up so that the interest rate (coupon) equals that required yield and therefore the present value is equal to the loan principal. For a security, however the coupon rate is already determined so the required yield is applied to the projected cash flows in order to calculate a present value ( the price an investor is prepared to pay for the specified cash flows) Typically the required yield for a debt security is the yield to maturity. Note that this may be a discount or premium. Using the Spread lets you calculat e a yield from another observed yield as follows: Yield 1 = risk free yield Spread is to Yield 2 which is the instrument you are pricing. Earlier notes from Strucured finance review of prices quoted in relative terms: The price quoted in reference to an index e.g. LIBOR+50bp i.e. the yield. (the rate which is currently LIBOR)+50 is the price, and 50bp is the spread. e.g. Price:101% Yield = Benchmark + spread Price of 101% can be expressed as LIBOR+50 or Treasury+20 so these are separate ways of expressing the same thing. The one thing which is the price is expressed in these different ways. note also that unlike equities there's not a range of different price results from this. Spread = analytic. Bond has Price + yield. then compared to today's 90 day treasury value it's Spread is X, compared with (1 month) LIBOR its spread is Y and so on.

standardized terms set	"The things that are standardized: The strike price Contract size Expiry Date These three are standardized regardless of what exchange they are on. Each exchange has a standard for these specific terms, for contracts that are traded on that exchange. Expiry: there is a standard date that the exchange will have, for example in the US it is the Saturday following the third Friday of every month. So there is a set expiration date for all exchange traded optons Strike: there are set increments for strike for exchange traded options. Contract sizes are also stipulated, for example in the US these are standardized by the OPRA Convention (Options Pricing Reporting Authority). Ajay: Exchange traded is tri party contract with central counterparty for the setelemtn fo the options. Market place (usually electronic), hence standard to process data. Not necessarily a legal difference? So for instance you would not be able to trade different lot sizes. So they enter in the contract which is guaranteed by the exchange. Members of the exchange trade with each other. The Exchange then being a third party. OTC: Bilateral Exchange traded: Still bilateral, using standardized terms. Lookalikes: for examples, where there are usually ones with monthly margin calls (exchange traded), there are 'lookalike' ones which look like an ET but are traded outside the market. Common in commodities market. What else can be standardised? What must be standardidsed? Date Convention: Standardized by juridction US: All single-Equity Options are American; all European exercise for Indices. This is not a convention for say London, where various conventions may exist on different contracts."	rel:editorialNote	1

So you would get an email from the sales person at the bank who has just closed the deal and is now selling these (this bank is the broker/dealer who bought it?) There's not really much of a secondary market - the initial investors would often hold on to these. There is something around Bloomberg - you can go there and see what's available, if someone has a number of notes from a iven tranche, that they are willing to sell. So there's no transpoarency (!!) Sales would be OTC but less transparent e.g. if you look up a normal OTC stock, you would be able to see more of this information, than in these (non Agency) MBS issues and other SF.

floating interest rate	"The index used to determine the specific interest rate is generally included in the terms of the loan. In most cases, lenders will also charge a spread, or added percentage points on top of the established index rate. If a loan is billed as prime plus 2.5 percent, for a prime rate of 3.5 percent, the terms of the loan will require the borrower to pay off a 6 percent interest. Floating interest rates typically involve periodic reset dates for the loan, particularly when the index rate changes.

Student Loans: The student may be the borrower, or the parent may be the borrower on behalf of the student. Student would not normally be a co-borrower but in theory it could. The co-borrower is someone with more established credit. Other factors: legal age - you need ot be of legal age in order to sign the Loan Contract, this is because you have to be a Legal Entity. so then the adult is simply the Borrower. Also potentially have references on the loan. These would come in handy later. These may be related to the student or the borrower."	rel:editorialNote	1

tax reclaim activity	"We dont' have detailed information on what kinds of activities there are, but there may be a broad range of these. For instance, may be giving the issuer's location, or the rules for tax reclaims. Different rules exist. May set the rules on each action. For instance, It versus Fr, different rules. The CA notificaiton may be setting out the rules on each tax reclaim. Example: Aus: Issuer may make declaration to tax department, that securities are widely issued, this has some effect on withholding etc. Countries may have standing rules fo rreclaims, but may be special rules at an issue action level for large issue action. this would go out as a message (notification) using this message code. Similar to VAT in Canada - as an individual you pay VAT and reclaim it when you leave the country. Fill out a form etc. Then they send the VAT back. Conclusions: A general activity of Tax Reclaim - not formally modeled, just iterated here; notification which is the SWIFT message notoification type."	rel:definition	1

pool backed securities deal	"The issue of a series of Pool Backed Security certificates. These are (at least in this context) securities issued backed by a pool of individual loans, mortgages or other individual loan products."	rel:definition	1
pool backed securities deal	"This term makes the distinction, perhaps artificial, between deals backed by pools of individual debt (this term), and deals backed by pools of securities (collateralized deals). This structure of relations between kinds of deals may prove to be a little artificial, but it reflects the structure of relations between kinds of securities, arrived at in earlier SME reviews. That is, Pool Backed Security (which breaks down into ABS and MBS) has a pool of individual loan products (a sub type of which is mortgage loans). The terms reflect the fact that in common parlance the term \"ABS\" is taken to mean something which is explicitly NOT a MBS but can be any other type of loan or credit based security, hence the creation of the non standard term \"Pool Backed Security\". The naming of deals simply attempts to reflect that. Terms to be included in Deal (per PoC conversations): Underwriters Issuer Deal Number Series number Deal Value Different collateral pools that support the deal. Review existing terms and make sure all covered."	rel:editorialNote	1

Certain statutory clauses (such as those dealing with allotment, transfer, and forfeiture of shares) must be included; the other clauses are chosen by the stockholders to make up the bylaws of the organization. A court, however, may declare a clause ultra vires if it is deemed unfair, unlawful, or unreasonable. A copy of the articles is lodged with the appropriate authority such as the registrar of companies. Articles are public documents and may be inspected by anyone (usually on payment of a fee) either at the premises of the organization or at the registrar's office. Lenders to the organization take special interest in its provisions that impose a ceiling on the borrowings beyond which the organization's management must get shareholders' approval before taking on more debt.

rights distribution	"Does the Rights Distribution have to be proportion to the Shareholding? Sometimes this is offered at market prices, so all you are doing is offering shareholders the right to purchase. Conclusion: Not \"in proportion\" at all. REVISE: May also have Bonus Rights Issue, where you don' have a subscriptiojn price. This works like a rights issue but without a price attached to it. The rate of how many you can buy is definitely in proportion to your holding. The rate of distribution of the right is proportional to the holdings. Another difference: A Rights thing you have to pay for the additional shares if you choose to purchase them (exercise the right) whereas a Bonus Issue you do not pay, you get them outright for free. TWO PARTS: 1. Distribution of the rights in proportion to their holding 2. Exercise of the Rights. Hence RHDI v EXRI where EXRI is the exercising of the right to purchase the shares. The Rights that are distributed is a formal \"Rights\" instrument. This may have the sort of features we see in other rights instruments, such as restriction in when you can exercise it."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

The drawee stamps ACCEPTED on the draft and is thereafter obligated to make the specified payment when it is due. If the drawee is a bank, the acceptance is called a bankers acceptance (BA). A bankers acceptance is an obligation of the accepting bank. Depending on the bank's reputation, a payee may be able to sell the bankers acceptance - that is, sell the time draft accepted by the bank. It will sell for the discounted value of the future payment. In this manner, the bankers acceptance becomes a discount instrument traded in the money market. Paying discounted value for a time draft is called discounting the draft.

gross domestic product	"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of the goods and services produced by the nation’s economy less the value of the goods and services used up in production. GDP is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. Conceptually, this measure can be arrived at by three separate means: as the sum of goods and services sold to final users, as the sum of income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services, and as the sum of the value added at each stage of production. Although these three ways of measuring GDP are conceptually the same, their calculation may not result in identical estimates of GDP because of differences in data sources, timing, and estimation techniques."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

third party corporate action	"For example an offer made in the context of a takeover bid. Quesytion: if a third party makes such an action, doe sthe issuer also have to send out the notification? If the company is listed ,then the issuer is also obligated to notify holders that this thing is taking place. If both companies are listed, both have to send out a notificaiton to the market that they are doing this action. So the target company has to notify the market. sothere is a separate message which is the target company notifying its holders that a Tender Offer etc. is taking place. Is this in the ISO 15022 list? Are they both done with the same message? Example: Company B makes a bid in private to Company A. Discussion may go on in private. At some point you have to legally make it clear. So then Company A says \"we are being approached by company B\" and Company B has to put out a message saying \"We are going to try and take over Company B\". Are they the same message? The \"Tender Offer\" message type is rich enough that both things can be conveyed. So when we try to semantically distinguish the message from the action? The party making the bid completes different fields in the message, to those filled in by the target company. This then marks out the semantics of \"This is a bid offer and I am the 3rd party\" or \"I am reporting a bid offer\". Semantically: There is an event and there is a message describing the event. TElling the market about something happening to a company can be something your company is doing, or something causing a change in circumstances. Either way, the issuer of the affected securities has to identify and notify that there is something which might be affecting the price of their securities. May be internal or external things, and either way the issuer has to notify the market."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

Investopedia explains Weighted Average Coupon - WAC For example, suppose a MBS is composed of two different pools of mortgages: $6 million worth of mortgages that yield 7.5% and a pool of $4 million mortgages that yield 5%. The WAC would be 6.5%. The WAC on a mortgage-backed security is an important piece of information used by analysts to estimate the pre-pay characteristics of that security. It is an important relative value tool in MBS portfolio management and analysis."	rel:editorialNote	1

autonomous agent	"Agents, then, can be software agents, hardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents, and so on.  While software developers naturally think of IT systems as being constructed of only software agents, a combination of agent mechanisms might in fact be used from shop-floor manufacturing to warfare systems.  The definition incorporated herein must be sufficiently general to account for these and other uses, such as for describing people and organizations who participate in broader processes and systems, for FIBO, other OMG standards and usage, and in general.\n\nWhether or not you restrict your view of agents to the software variety, most agree that agents deployed for IT systems are not useful without the following three important properties:\n\n(1) Autonomous - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention.  Agents have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and processing that enable them to act without any external choreography.  When an agent acts on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing, its autonomy is expected to embody the goals and policies of the entity that it represents.\n\n(2) Interactive - an agent communicates with the environment and other agents. Agents are interactive entities because they are capable of exchanging rich forms of messages with other entities in their environment.  These messages can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification.  They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature.  The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query.\n\n(3) Adaptive - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to messages and events and then respond appropriately.  Agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences.  They can learn and evolve."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

contract for difference	"Cash settled contract where you buy or sell control of a particular asset such as USD. Further notes: You don't expect to deliver it, instead, at the end of the stated period you will take the current market value of the asset and pay the difference between the current market value and the value that you contracted for. Review session notes: Q: What are they? A: Cash settled contract where you buy or sell control of a particular asset such as USD. You don't expect to deliver it, instead, at the end of th estated period you will take the current market value of the asset and pay the difference between the current market value and the value that you contracted for. Just the same as a non deliverable forward. Differences: CFD are more a retail based product, they don't speciy a delivery date, they roll on a daily basis, the holder pays a margin but they don't determine the date where you have to settle. They rollover each day, but each day the holder has to provide a margin (and fees). Can roll along as long as you like, squaring up the current value and roll on for next day. No option to gake any value out of it. You can choose to terminate it, at which point youclear it at its current market value on that day and don't roll it over for the next. Developed to allow peopl ewho don't have the ability to hold the cash, to run a balance in a foreign ccy. What sort of assets? 1. Currency 2. No others known. Logically possible. Can be equity or anything. Q: What sort of facts apply: Delivery dates Quantities For non uniform assets: grades or qualities of those assets (e.g. oil0 Counterparties Earlier notes: Notes taken during Traded options SME Review: Traded in Australia and LSE.

price parameter specification	"Two significant examples of this pricing method are 1. Yields a yield is expressed as the annualized interest Rate that an investor requires for an investment. In the case of a loan the terms are set up so that the interest rate (coupon) equals that required yield and therefore the present value is equal to the loan principal. For a security, however the coupon rate is already determined so the required yield is applied to the projected cash flows in order to calculate a present value ( the price an investor is prepared to pay for the specified cash flows) Typically the required yield for a debt security is the yield to maturity 2. Volatilities in reality a volatility (used to calculate the fair value of an option) is a measure of the variability of the price of the transaction over which the beneficiary of the option has control. This is the primary parameter passed into an option valuation (eg Black-Scholes, Binomial) Notes Origin: NAB"	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

So talking a bout balance sheet or off balanc sheet, this is about creating the pool which is going to be sold off. This applies whether hte pool is cash (real holdings) or synthetics. Either way ,the instruments are transferred into the CPV to sell them off. conclusion: applies to cash and non cash. In the old days there were all sorts of guarantees added to that SPOV.

prepayment speed	"This is a model. Includes other factors such as homogeniety. Earlier notes: Same as Payment. Curtailment. Paydown is normally scheduled payments of the mortgage. Prepayment is when someone pays off the mortgage early I may send in 1500 when my monthly amount is 1000 a month. So the 500 is a prepayment. Scheduled principal payment. More notes 25 nov: Also factor in changes to the pool constituents where this is allowed for that kind of MBS. So we make estimates of how face value will will change. face value won't change but the underlying value of the Pf changes, so eg. the current mortgage factor. Model update note June 2010: Detailed types of \"Prepayment Speed\" analytic received from thomson Reuters, now modeled as sub types of this term. So term origin is PSA by extension, since this is the common super class of 3 specific prepayment speed analytic types defined by PSA. PSA stands for Public Securities Association. Type: PSA gives this as numeric, however definitions imply percentage, so defined as dated percentage for now.

(%) e.g. 100% PSA is applied to model. 200% PSA implies x%CPR per month Tries to reflect how prepayments in a pool will accelerate and then burn out. This reflects the nature of a mortgage pool, elgl why people will prepay, refinance, address selection and so on i.e. local economy facts. so those will drop out of the pool and you are left with those who will not. that's why it levels off. So who originates these figures? Is it measured ongoing?: No . Used to determine a pricing speed when marketing the security to investors. So this is part of the primary market / issuance where there is marketing. These are the estimated figures as they will be at issue. PSA may also be used as triggers. 100 - 400% PSA band - if you go outside that band, may change payment behaviour of those classes.

mortgage pool	"The class Mortgage Pool originally had a property 'pool type' referring to a selection list of textual stylings of pool types. Those are now replaced with actual sub types of mortgage pool. Here are the original notes and definition that went with the enumerated list of pool types: \n\nThe type of pool for a pool backed security. Each of these pool types represents pools of mortgages that have conformed to certain standards (that change periodically) that make them \"conforming\" -- such as mortgage balance under a certain threshold, creditworthiness, loan-to-value, etc.\n\nFurther Notes:\nNon Agency signifies a tranched security, for which there will also be a Tranche Type for the security tranche itself. All other pool types are Agency pool types. \n\nList Populated from Cutter document Page 5. \n\nAdditional terms from Adept Advistory:\nUnder Agency mortgages, basically you have various types of pools under the various agencies. You have:\n-GNMA-I\n-GNMA-II\n-GNMA Platinum\n-FNMA \n-FHLMC\n-FHLMC Gold\nAs far as definitions:The simple definition is that each of these pool types represents pools of mortgages that have conformed to certain standards (that change periodically) that make them \"conforming\" -- such as mortgage balance under a certain threshold, creditworthiness, loan-to-value, etc. Also, GNMA is explicitly backed by the US government, while FNMA and FHLMC are only implicitly backed by the US government.

credit agreement terms	"Includes terms for construction loans and other agreements which, while labeled as loans, are agreements to make loan advances at certain times and under certain conditions in the future. ACTIONS: Still need to connect these terms together in the overall model for Construction Loans and the rest. For now, added this term to take care of detail terms sets that are otherwise orphans. 14 July: What form does the set of terms of the commitment take? - will define a set of parameters or limits under which you are prepared to lend money. These may include: Pledges, negative pledges; pledge of security that is available to you if you lend the loan/ also restrictions on how frequently the tranche can be drawn down whether or under what conditions you can re-draw. These terms will determine the nature of the loan. so for example a student loan will have quite a restrictive facility. The facility probably on't just pay you money, it may for instance pay against a receipt for the fees, or may pay the institution directly. These terms are designed to control the credit risk that the lender (or ultimate lender) is going to take. Also you are charged for providing that facility - the bank, once it's made that commitment, will have had to set aside capital. They have no control of when you are going to draw down on that loan, so the bank has to ensure that when you do they don't exceed their capital requirements. There is a fee to cover this. Syndicated lending is more complex - there would be multiple lenders when the draw-down takes place - the potential lenders are numerous, and will be beyond the credit limits of any individual bank. these have agents, managers and so on, as well as the syndicate members who participate in the lending. Manager: does all the organization. calls people (lenders) together when the borrower makes a draw down, and distributes this. See Syndicate Loan diagram. This can be turned into multiple actual loans. There would be separate limits in these, based on currency, risk type and so on (as per Credit Facility generally). So one might use the borrowing for trade finance, revolving credit facility, straight draw-down, all specified in terms of the limits (maximum amounts that the lenders are prepared to give). A facility may also be a stand-by facility - one you may never want to draw down but need as protection."	rel:editorialNote	1

Stock exchanges also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of securities as well as other financial instruments and capital events including the payment of income and dividends.\n\nThe securities traded on a stock exchange include: shares issued by companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, it has to be listed there. Usually there is a central location at least for recordkeeping, but trade is less and less linked to such a physical place, as modern markets are electronic networks, which gives them advantages of speed and cost of transactions.

Such choices would include: - Currency - Pay in Kind (\"Spinoff\" or PiK - see PiK corporate Action) Could be mandatory.

A: The ones with Choices come as announcements and don't ave to be generated by the Service. Older definitin (re-scoped now: An Event in which a payment occurs. Anything can have a payment event. If a thing hits a pay date, whether it's voluntary or mandatory, that's a payment event. Divide into: Securities Cash Combination Payment or Distribution? Are these exclusive?

reference obligation	"FpML adds \"Furthermore the Reference Obligation is ALWAYS deliverable and establishes the Pari Passu ranking (as the deliverable bonds must rank equal to the reference\" however this is not borne out in all cases (sometimes the Deliverable Obligation is NOT the Reference Obligation. This term is what we are referrring to when we refer to the credit event. This is what you are referencing to determine whether or not a default has occurred. Note: Loans as Reference Obligation: If the Ref Ob is a loan you can't establish that a default event has occurred but would have to specify some other event that can be obvserved to objectively determine that there has been a default. For example, you might have a loan for a company but monitor a bond issued by that company. If the bond defaults, the deliverable obligation may be the loan or some cash settlement based on the value of that loan (more typically). Detailed Review Notes: Q: Where does it go from here: thing or event? A: Commonly refers to an instrument, i.e. \"This is the instrument we are looking at; if this instrument defaults then we are going to pay out on the protection leg.

arbitrage cdo	"Arbitrage deals are motivated by the opportunity to add value by repackaging collateral into tranches. This is the same motivation for most CMOs. In finance, the law of one price suggests that the securities of a CDO should have the same market value as its underlying collateral. In practice, this is often not the case. Accordingly, a CDO can represent a theoretical arbitrage. april 28 note: Does this have meaning for Cash CDO? Are these always? Arbitrage is there to exploit market inefficiencies. Would there not be some arbitrage exploited in the CDO. The definition here implies cash CDO only. not cler to reviewers what the ditinctio nis and whether these are mutually excluive. On eview is that the arb CDO has cash inflorws different to cash outflows, e.g. 9.5% v 9% with the 50bp taken as fees. So that might be Arb CDO. There is another type we hav emissed: like an arb CDO where there is instead a spread between in/out as above, you have instead a MArket Value CDO, where its base don the market value of the deal. Not clear how you are supposed to realized that value. you are supposed to realize the xxxx of securities .Seen both referred to. So is arb a risk management tool."	rel:editorialNote	1

The credit spread reflects the additional net yield an investor can earn from a security with more credit risk relative to one with less credit risk. The credit spread of a particular security is often quoted in relation to the yield on a credit risk-free benchmark security or reference rate. Further Notes There are several measures of credit spread, including Z-spread and option-adjusted spread. Old definition (Algo) The spread between the credit rating of something and its maturity. THis is now defined as a different term pending further review with Algorithmics. Update from SMER. difference between risk free price (price of govt bond) and the price of this security.

privately held company	"A firm whose issued shares are all held by a family or a small group of investors and, therefore, cannot be bought by the public."	rel:definition	1
privately held company	"Wikipedia: definition for British or Commonwealth version: A private company limited by shares is a type of company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, Scotland, that of certain Commonwealth countries and the Republic of Ireland. It has shareholders with limited liability and its shares may not be offered to the general public, unlike those of public limited companies. Additional notes from Wikipedia: Limited by shares means that the company has shareholders, and that the liability of the shareholders to creditors of the company is limited to the capital originally invested, i.e. the nominal value of the shares and any premium paid in return for the issue of the shares by the company. A shareholders personal assets are thereby protected in the event of the companys insolvency, but money invested in the company will be lost. A limited company may be private or public. A private limited companys disclosure requirements are lighter, but for this reason its shares may not be offered to the general public (and therefore cannot be traded on a public stock exchange). This is the major distinguishing feature between a private limited company and a public limited company. Most companies, particularly small companies, are private. Private companies limited by shares are required to have the suffix Limited (often written Ltd or Ltd.) or Incorporated (Inc.) as part of their name, though the latter cannot be used in the UK or the Republic of Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, Teoranta (Teo.) may be used instead, largely by Gaeltacht companies. Cyfyngedig (Cyf.) may be used by Welsh companies in a similar fashion."	rel:editorialNote	1

mandatory put event	"There is a Put Bond, which is a kind of option in the sense that in return for getting less yield it allows you to put it back to the issuer. This means Put is a voluntary event. Therefore Mandatory Put is nonsensical? discussion: Or is it? If you are the issuer (therefore the granter of the option) then the event is to the holder). Partly paid shre for example gives the issuer the right to call funds but also has the right to put. So put is not by definition ... someone can have the right to put something. Conclusion: these do not appear to make sense as terms. A put bond allows the holder to redeem the issue. So this is by definition a voluntary event. Conclusion: go back to Pershing and find out what this term meant. Also we don't even know what kind of security this event was intended to refer to. We assume it refers to Put bond.

If, however, \"Automatic Early Termination\" is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8)."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

mortgage instrument weighted average remaining maturity	"Synonym (if this is the same term): Also known as \"average effective maturity\". Investopedia explains Weighted Average Maturity - WAM The measure is calculated by totaling each mortgage value represented by the MBS. The weights of each mortgage is found by dividing the value of each into the total of all. To arrive at the WAM number the weight of each security is multiplied by the time until maturity of each mortgage, and then all the values are added together. For example say an MBS has three mortgages valued at $1,000, $2,000 and $3,000 (a total of $6,000) and mature in one, two and three years respectively. The weights of these are 1/6 (1,000/6,000), 1/3 (2,000/6,000) and 1/2 (3,000/6,000). The WAM is 2 1/3 years (1/6 x 1 year + 1/3 x 2 years + 1/2 x 3 years). Analysis: this investopedia decription does not take account of there being more than one Pool behind the MBS."	rel:editorialNote	1

average life	"Where it refers to pre-payment above, if the bond does not include prepayment then this is not included. However, analytics that refer to this e.g. Yield to Average Life, then this figure is relevant. It is not relevant for other types of bond where e.g. you would use yield to next call, yield to worst etc. Average Life used in place of Maturity for Yield Calculation. This is not only used for Yield calculations though. It is referred to as an analytic figure in its own right. Average Life uses one of a number of standard pre-payment models (for structured finance at least). For MBS, the average life includes some calculations to take account of pre-payments on the underlying mortgages. This takes account of the possibillity of borrowers paying early. This has to be modeled or forecast (not given) as it's a function of market conditions and interest rate. You would not see this in a market data feed. When you model MBS you calculate Average Life as part of the model i.e. you estimate the percentage of prepayment in the next x length of time and factor this into the Average Life. Refers to Weighted Average Time to receipt of future cash flows. For MBS, early payments will shorten the Average Life. For Student Loans, Credit Card, Loan etc, i.e. all Pool Backed (any bond that has securitized debt). Other bonds: Sinking Funds etc., also Early Payment - partial Call for a corporate / regular bond. Early Payment for pass through has the same effect. Sinking Fund: Each payment is part principal and part interest, this is implicit in the overall definition of \"Early payment\"."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

cds periodic payment schedule	"The amount can be specified in terms of a known currency amount or as an amount calculated on a formula basis by reference to a per annum fixed rate. The applicable business day convention and business day for adjusting any fixed rate payer payment date if it would otherwise fall on a day that is not a business day are to be specified. Review notes: Note that both of the above possibilities refer to the amount, not the determination of dates. It is assumed that this is always a specification of how to determine the dates (a schedule specification) and not an explicit list of dates and amounts on each date. If the latter is applicable, a term for this needs to be added as a type of \"Explicit Schedule\"."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

swap	"The most common type is an interest rate swap, in which one party agrees to pay a fixed interest rate in return for receiving a adjustable rate from another party. Review session notes: 10 Mar Helpful to split these according to the assets that are swapped. So for instance there are equity swaps, commodity swaps where you swap different assets. These are not mutually exclusive to labels about Fund Leg, and so on, that are different ways that people trading in those assets distinguish between those legs. For example in IR, we talk Fixed, Floating. capital Index Swap, where the return on oen leg is indexed to an inflation index but it's still an IR swap where the payment relates to an inflation index. So keeping the 2 legs in some sort of notion balance - example index annuity swap, capital index swap and so on. These terms refer to the behavior of the underlying swap rather than an arbitrary classification of what leg is what. Different structures of swap is less relevant. 17 March: Remember: the contract does not necessarily have 2 legs, but it usually would. The structure is in the transactions, i.e., the commitments embodied in the terms for the two sides of those transactions, the legs which are simply the embodiment of those commitments, and so on. Then the details structure is in the leg definitions. Note also that different kinds of leg can have various structures regardless of how or why they are used in a contract."	rel:editorialNote	1

parametric schedule	periodic scheduled event date	rel:hasRecurrenceStartDate	1
parametric schedule	"This is a schedule for one of the events that occur in a periodic schedule of interest accruals, interest payments, and (for floating rate swapstreams), changes to the interest rate. These may be specified individually but more commonly the Calculation event is the one scheduled according to this kind of parametric schedule, with the other dates specified as an offset to these. Here we have allowed for each of the related dates to be independently parametrically scheduled. The notional amount step schedule is a separate kind of schedule, with similar terms but without a period length. For calculation schedules (and possibly payments, resets), there is a different end date to the end /start of the period, since events may be specified as being on specific dates - this is where the Roll Convention comes in. This has the same basic concepts as the generic schedule shown as the parent to this. However, where the upper model has Date with various applicable sub types (known i.e. calendar, specified or determined). For example, an ISDA FpML schedule has a Specified Date (via a convention), and then has a date roll rule which is specified for the whole schedule and applies to each of the dates returned by the parametric specification of the schedule. It has: A schedule beginning and end; A set of regular repeating periods: the scheduled event takes place once per period; Optionally one or two stubs (one start and one end); these may be longer than the repeating period, or shorter. The precise parameters used are: Start of the overall Schedule period: Effective Date End of the overall Schedule period: Termination Date Start of first regular period: not specified (assume Effective Date?) Length of each regular period: Frequency (actually a duration) There are generally three ways in which the regular periods of a parametric schedule may be expressed: first plus last first plus period length last plus period length event date plus period length. In FpML, Roll events (the date that something rolls over from the value used in one period to the value used in the next) is defined in a Roll Convention, which may be a day of the month, a day of the week, or some published set of dates, typically the ISDA quarterly dates for these events. This is therefore the date within the regular period (before adjustments) when the event occurs. This is in addition so a date for the start or end of such a period. In general this applies to the Calculation Schedule (i.e. the event is the calculation event) with other dates specified relative to this, however in principle the other related events (payment and reset or refix) are specified relative to this. It is not immediately clear what specification of a date replaces the Roll event convention element when this happens."	rel:editorialNote	1

establishment	"The physical location of a certain economic activity - for example, a factory, mine, store, or office. An individual establishment is generally classified by having one NAICS code associated with it for statistical purposes, whereas an enterprise may be classified by multiple NAICS codes. The statistical structure is defined based on the operating structure and the accounting data produced by that entity.  A given location may only need to publish revenues, whereas an operating unit (establishment) has employment statistics, etc.  An establishment is defined as a producing unit at a single geographical location at which or from which economic activity is conducted and for which, at a minimum, employment data are available.  In the case of a home-based business, the actual physical location would be specified as two distinct institutional units - as a household from a personal living and consumer perspective and as an establishment / operating unit due to the statistics required of the business."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

fee payment leg	"Review session notes: Q: whether this is any different to a regular Payment Leg. Answers: This is the \"other\" side of the swap from credit protection, i.e. the payment side. You are going to pay a set of fixed payments in return for a payment that occurs in the event of the credit event. So this is not incorrect but not a useful name for it. Swap is swap of a set of payments that equates the credit margin in return for the payments that apply in the case of the credit event. Conclusions: A good name for it might be the Credit Margin, at least from the point of view of the protection buyer, as this is the margin they are paying for the credit protection."	rel:editorialNote	1

debenture	"From Wikipedia: In law, a debenture is a document which either creates a debt or acknowledges it. It is a medium to long-term borrowing facility created by a company. Where repayment is secured by a charge over land, the document is called a 'mortgage'. Where repayment is secured by a charge other assets of the company, the document is called a 'debenture'. Where no security is involved, the document is called a note or 'unsecured deposit note'. There are two types of debentures: 1. Convertible Debentures, which are convertible bonds or bonds that can be converted into equity shares of the issuing company after a predetermined period of time. \"Convertibility\" is a feature that corporations may add to the bonds they issue in order to make them more attractive to buyers. In other words, it is a special feature that a corporate bond may carry. As a result of the advantage a buyer gets from the ability to convert, convertible bonds typically have lower interest rates than non-convertible corporate bonds. 2. Non-Convertible Debentures, which are simply regular debentures, cannot be converted into equity shares of the liable company. They are debentures without the convertibility feature attached to them. As a result, they usually carry higher interest rates than their convertible counterparts."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

forward contract	"Unlike futures contracts (which occur through a clearing firm), forward contracts are privately negotiated and are not standardized. Further, the two parties must bear each other's credit risk, which is not the case with a futures contract. Also, since the contracts are not exchange traded, there is no marking to market requirement, which allows a buyer to avoid almost all capital outflow initially (though some counterparties might set collateral requirements). Given the lack of standardization in these contracts, there is very little scope for a secondary market in forwards. The price specified in a forward contract for a specific commodity. The forward price makes the forward contract have no value when the contract is written. However, if the value of the underlying commodity changes, the value of the forward contract becomes positive or negative, depending on the position held. Forwards are priced in a manner similar to futures. Like in the case of a futures contract, the first step in pricing a forward is to add the spot price to the cost of carry (interest forgone, convenience yield, storage costs and interest/dividend received on the underlying). Unlike a futures contract though, the price may also include a premium for counterparty credit risk, and the fact that there is not daily marking to market process to minimize default risk. If there is no allowance for these credit risks, then the forward price will equal the futures price."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

Outcome: these would be specialised kinds of pools of loans and are therefore reflected by specific typs of Cash ABS, in the same way as Auto Loan ABS are defined.

bonus issue	"There are different taxation rules for the Bonus Issue compared to the Dividend. There could also be a difference in the ranking of the shares that are given, to what the holder already holds. Always announce the event on the ones that they hold, and based on the holding they are given additional shares. They may be of a different ranking. Bonus Issues increase the capital base but not the capital value of the company, since all they are doing is diluting the share capital. Difference from Dividend: Increases holding of shareholder. Other similar terms: Awards; Also see difference between Dividend and Bonus. Dividend is from current profits and bonus may be from accumulated reserves of the company. Separate this into 2 terms. We have: Capitalisation Issue Bonus rights Issue Original SWIFT definition - strippoed out synonyms for the formal definition above: \"Attribution Gratuite (FR); Scrip Issue (GB); Capitalisation Issue. Security holders are awarded additional assets free of payment from the issuer in priportion to their holding.\" More 25 May A scrip issue is the issue of new shares at no charge pro rata to the holder of existing shares. This means the term Scrip Issue is as modeled here \"no charge\". But Capitalization becomes close to this in definition. More detail May 25: No change to the par value of the share so why would there be a change inthe capitaliation? Because from an accountingf point of view they change the value of overall capital of the company - they don't change the market value of the conpany but the accountants will record an increase in the issued capital of the company. This is the disctinction between nominal capital and the market capital. Nominal - there is more nominal share value."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

law	"Law is a term which does not have a universally accepted definition. Certain laws are made by governments, specifically by their legislatures although the sense intended here is broader. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution (written or unwritten) and the rights encoded therein.  The law shapes politics, economics and society in countless ways and serves as a social mediator of relations between people."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

debenture securitization conditions	"From original model (whose?): A debenture is usually unsecured in the sense that there are no liens or pledges on specific assets. It is however, secured by all properties not otherwise pledged. From Wikipedia A debenture (also called a note) is an unsecured corporate bond or a corporate bond that does not have a certain line of income or piece of property or equipment to guarantee repayment of principal upon the bond's maturity. Debentures are long-term debt instrument used by large companies to obtain funds. Where securities are offered, loan stocks or bonds are termed 'debentures' in the UK or 'mortgage bonds' in the US. Summary: Therefore they are unsecured in the sense of not having a particular cash flow allocated to them, but they are therefore secured by some other asset."	rel:editorialNote	1

covariance leg terms	"Original review note: Co-variance Leg Another statistical swap leg type where the stike determines the payout. Structured the same as the Correlation Leg. more notes 17 March: Covariane is actually the way you measure correlation. So people talk about this as a statistical leg but actually Talks about movement of price THe highter the covariance between two prices the more correlated they are. more general note: unlike fx market where e.g. I cna build a price out od AUS/USD and build a price out of that. In option markets I don't have that opportunity - one owiuld end up overpricing the option. The variability in the price of AUS/USD v AUS/GBP impacts on these calculations. By using three legs I cna put together a cros inthe options. Buy Aus/USD Option, .buy USD/GBP Option and sell the correlation Swap. This sells the correlationbeteen AUS/USD and AUS/GBP leaving me with a realistic price for AUS/GBP thereby enabling me to cross markets. So the swap enables me not to end up overpricing the option. THis basic principle is why correslation swaps are used. So correslation is a relatively new concept."	rel:editorialNote	1
covariance leg terms	"A statistical leg based on covariance. REVIEW: This kmight specify the same kind of thing as Correlation Leg using different mathematics / different legal terms (in which case we need to model it as a different thing even though to the investor it has the same rationale and behavior.

So this adds a time base to the Correlation calculation. difference with Correelation: The time base in correlation swap is implicit anyway (it's the duration of the contract. so Covariance is what allows you to explan x% of the vaqriabiltiy of the price of this asset with relation to that asset."	rel:definition	1

If payment is once a month, then once a month you make the payment, the information goes to the Servicer (whether or not thi is the originating bank). They keep a running total. they decrement the principal and so on. So this is monthly because the payments are monthly. They have the reports of the monies received and so on. All this is provided to the Conservatorships (where this happens) ,and are kept as individual records there AND are aggregated for accounting and risk management purposes. For securities, need to go down to the quality level of the individual loans when they put then in the pools. Further to this: this is for dynamic MBS / ABS securities (dynmaic versus static loan pools and securities based on these). If it's fixed and is in place and being serviced, there is no way to change the terms of the security. If it defaults, then the original contract is defective. with dynmaci, similar to managed CDO in that the content of the pool can be changed. Earlier note Fannie Mae: the initial assessment of the borrower in terms of Credit worthiness and financial status. taken by the broker organization. the financial status of the borrower, as well as down payment, credit rating etc. is taken into account by \"Pre-approval\". Preappoval means the broker is submitting the loan to Fannie Mae with the idea that it would meet the criteria to be purchasable by Fannie Mae. When all this is verified these are sent to Fannie Mae and then we have \"agreements\" or \"commitments\" that are in the pipeline - in the process of being processed or closed, then there are x many fixed, variable and so on. Then Fannie Mae will estimate how many loans it will be purchasing by aggregating all those. Meanwhile: Loan servicing - if this identified late payments or missed payments, then there may be another assessment of the borrower's credit worthiness. If going into foreclosure, would be another assessment. Once the loans are purchased, the concerns are simply calculating LTV (on property side, for a mortgage), which changes with payment and market value. Gets aggregated for various kinds of risk assessment and exposure assessment. The reporting by the servicer is monthly regardless of the payment frequency of the loan. Corporate versus Personal: Are the same kinds of facts assessed? Is the assessment still monthly? Agency (conservatorship): as above, once the loan is in a pool, the servicer reports to them. ALSO: If the loan is transferred from one pool etc. to another. Meanwhile: Borrower may be any Legal Entity, even for agency loans. they capture the party role, the relationship between the party and a security, and the relationship between a party and a pool of loans. Allows for a range of kinds of party. See tables of info on loan pools. 35 logical tables about the loan itself. Borrower (in old common data model in Fannie) for Borrower, has credit, per loan the mortgage insurer, the originator of the loan (bank, underwriter, brokerage etc.), the appraiser (of the property i.e. real estate, for mortgage), and for Loan borrower, the Borrower Type Code, whether ever bankrupt, amount of doan payment, borrower details, depth (Borrower v Borrower Liabilities); business expenses, Review notes: Identify the things about corporations that extend to persons and vice versa.

inflation bond	"Refers to an Inflation Index. This is used to define the factor or multiplier for the bond, that is the factor that you multiply the bond by. How this works is that you take the inflation rate when the security was issued, and the inflation rate at the present. The difference between these becomes the Factor, e.g. 100% -&gt; 101% gives 1% so for example for a $1000 issue - calculate the principal on which the interest is paid AND the principal from the point of view of how the principal is repaid. Some inflation bonds only do this on interest, some only on interest, but most apply it to the principal and interest. Coupon interest calculated based on the adjusted amount of the bond. so a fixed coupon rate is multiplied by e.g. 1010 in the example above. Variations e.g. Italy - daily published factor published for that bond, whereas other calculate based on underlying index. Typically a CPI or a statistical number generated by the govt. typically a lagging three month index. See UK bonds on this. US and Japanese ones - look at inflation rate 3 months prior. Unlike an Amortizing Security this principal value of the bond is increasing, whereas for and Amortizing, the principal is decreasing. In Canada, these are also referred to as \"real return bonds\". \nFurther Notes:Additional review with OTPP May 05 2010 indicates that this is part of a classification of bonds where the principal amount itself varies according to some index, a point which was not understood at the original review session. Terms and labels revised to fit this picture."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

Earlier notes this behaves very like a variance swap but instead of betting in pure variance you take a bet on dividend. What practically in one of these: The difference between th ereal life dividend and the one you think it should be. so I say it should bte 2% over the next 10 years, so I swap 2% for the actual dividend amount So then there is one single payment at the end which nets these up. So in the above example ... they are usually 3 month or 6 month contracts, so if for instance th edividend if quarterly, there might be 2 dividends where the difference is netted up at the end.for example. (Us 1/4ly usually , Eur 6 months). Depends on the company's articles of association etc. e.g. Unilever is 6 mo)/ Structurally, Div Swap corr Swap and Var Swap are structured similarly, with one strike at the beginning. Strike may be expressed in terms of the (price) variance (the variance of the returns) , the correlation between typically 2 underlyers. or the dividend for each of these three types of swap respectively. 17 march Dividend is a flow based on a share, so is this not the same as a Return Swap in that the dividend is the return on the dividend? Also recall that with stocks themselves, there is no comitment by the issuer to pay the dividends. FpML: 'Dividend leg.'; 'Floating Payment Leg of a Dividend Swap.'"	rel:definition	1

credit index	"Review session notes: Q: How does this differ from a basket of debt securities? A: Basket is defined as part of the contract. Whereas, with the Index, you don't reference the components. The index is based on a basket of risks (not a basket of debt instruments as such). So this is an indirection not a circularity as it is not an index of CDS contracts but of credit events as these effect a notional portfolio. In could be some form of valuation of underlying CDS (real or imagined). However this \"is\" the Reference Entity in the sense that it is what you refer to in order to determine the status of the portfolio, Contrast two types of CDS: Single Name and non singlename. With single name CDS: it's a binary process; if there's a default it's all over, as the contingent transaction kicks in. With indices if the index changes there would be partial payouts but the contract continues in existence,. It would pay out a portion of its value. The index indicates that some proportion has defaulted. Would deal with multi names. ALSO Index is not always a static portfolio, there may be proivisions for replacing defaulted securities. Need further research on the details. However, we only need to know them as something with a number and a publisher in order to model the CDS terms. See also: Credit Basket. This is locally defined and does form part of the CDS contract terms, but will have similar details to the index. SME Feedback - details of this term from OTPP: Because the indexes are maturity specific, it makes sense to have an entity AND an instrument with the corresponding maturity (or close to it) to measure the credit-risk of default. Premiums are standard and set depending on the composite spread at the initiation of the index, with upfront-fees to get into a deal thereafter depending on changes in the MTM of the spread. The payout per constituent credit-event is ~ Notional x weight. (cont'd - examples from OTPP): Credit-events and Payouts - Similar to single-name, and triggered by a constituent. The constituent is removed, the Notional*weight is paid, the remaining notional lowered, and the weighting re-balanced. Can be physical or cash settled. Looks like cash settled is becoming more popular. Notionals can be large but the payouts are small because of the small weights. Eg. $250MM Notional, 125 entities, weight is 1/125 for a defaulting entity = $2MM (simplified) transfer."	rel:editorialNote	1

realized variable swap side terms	"This generally defines the floating leg of a statistical type of swap or a dividend swap. The other leg of these swaps is implied, and is simply the strike. Payment is netted up at maturity and so there is no stream of cashflows either way. Earlier notes: Typically these are defined for swaps where there is only one leg; payments are determined at maturity of the swap contract and may go either way. Payments are determined by comparison of the value of the statistical measure at maturity with the pre-defined strike value of that parameter."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

repurchase agreement	"Most repos are overnight transactions, with the sale taking place one day and being reversed the next day. Long-term repos - called term repos - can extend for a month or more. Usually, repos are for a fixed period of time, but open-ended deals are also possible. Reverse repo is a term used to describe the opposite side of a repo transaction. The party who sells and later repurchases a security is said to perform a repo. The other party - who purchases and later resells the security - is said to perform a reverse repo. While a repo functions like the sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, but the legal reality and the economic effect is that of a secured loan. This is a loan as the original owner retains the rights to the cashflows of the underlying security. Economically, the party purchasing the security makes funds available to the seller and holds the security as collateral. If the repoed security pays a dividend, coupon or partial redemptions during the repo, this is returned to the original owner. The difference between the sale and repurchase prices paid for the security represent interest on the loan. Indeed, repos are quoted as interest rates. A repo always pays interest at maturity i.e. there are no periodic interest payments. Status: The above facts were agreed at review, definition to be reviewed for completeness after this reworking."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

cap determination	"The Strike rate is to be subtracted from the Observable rate on the reset date, to determine the settlement amount. This is incorrect. Cap applies to borrower. the Cap is the max amount I will pay to borrow. I take a capped rate. I am the buyer of the option. The market rate this time is higher than the capped rate. You as the seller of the option will pay me thedifference bwteen the capped rate and the market reate. If the market rate is lower than the capped rate no one pays anything because I will not exercise my right to that capped rate. So no money changes hands at settlement. Then: capped Loan: What I would be paying would be interest at the market rate if the market rate is lower, but if the market rate is higher then I would pay interest at the capped rate. This is the difference between a cap as a loan or as a cash settled thing. These represent different kinds of contract: Non loan one: Cap talks of settlement being difference between the market rate and the strike rate. This is cash settled. Name: \"Cap\" Loan one: Cap talks about a maximum interest rate payable by the holder, so the holder pays an amount each time, up to a maximum which is the Cap rate. Name: \"Capped Loan\" What manner of thin is this? A loan. Its ancestors are not OTC derivatives contracts thet are Loan."	rel:definition	1

A prime feature of most municipal securities is that interest or other investment earnings on them are generally excluded from gross income of the bondholder for federal income tax purposes. Some municipal securities are subject to federal income tax, although the issuers or bondholders may receive other federal tax advantages for certain types of taxable municipal securities.

controlled amortization bond	"Revolving debt (primarily credit card receivables, but also HELOCs, trade receivables, dealer floor-plan loans and some leases) may be securitized using a controlled amortization structure. This is a method of providing investors with a relatively predictable repayment schedule, even though the underlying assets are nonamortizing. Controlled-amortization ABS resemble corporate bonds with a sinking fund. After a predetermined “revolving” period during which only interest payments are made, these securities attempt to return principal to investors in a series of defined periodic payments that usually occur over less than a year. A risk inherent in this kind of ABS is an early amortization event. (See “Early-Amortization Risk,” on page 20.)"	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

basket of credit risks	credit index constituent	rel:hasConstituent	1
basket of credit risks	"From OTPP: Variety: Criteria for constituent entities is based on sectors (emerging market, financial, sovereign, etc), spread range (investment grade, non-investment grade), or asset type (loan, bond, mortgage-backed, asset-backed), second criteria is based on maturity of protection (2,3,5,7,10 yrs). As a result, I'm aware of over 2000 CDS indexes that Markit manages. Constituents can be on multiple indexes, based on maturity, etc. Because the indexes are maturity specific, it makes sense to have an entity AND an instrument with the corresponding maturity (or close to it) to measure the credit-risk of default. Premiums are standard and set depending on the composite spread at the initiation of the index, with upfront-fees to get into a deal thereafter depending on changes in the MTM of the spread. The payout per constituent credit-event is ~ Notional x weight. Modeling notes: Whereas this may be a basket of securities just like a \"Basket\" in the sense used in reference indices and in derivatives with basket underlyers, in this instance the constituents of the basket are collected, and are defined as constituents, in the context of the credit risks that they represent and not in the context of their market price as securities."	rel:editorialNote	1

For example, let's say you have a deal with a PAC tranche and a support tranche (i.e., a tranche that is a support tranche and is therefore subordinate to the PAC tranche) that has a scheduled payment structure like you did with the PAC bond.

otc master agreement right to termination following termination event	"This specifies an event which is predefined in the Agreement as constituting a Termination Event, with the effect that this right (tro termination) is invoked by the occurrence of that event. That is the assumption modeled here. ISDA Master Agreement example text in full: Right to Terminate Following Termination Event. (i) Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require. (ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist. If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i). Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other party&rsquo;s policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed. (iii) Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event. (iv) Right to Terminate. If:- (1) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or (2) an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party, either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/definitionOrigin>	1

optional underlying transaction	"A transaction which is defined in an options contract and which may or may not take place, at the discretion of the holder of the option. If it does take place, this will be a transaction for the purchase or sale of the deliverable underlying as defined in the option contract, or some cash equivalent thereof. Further notes: This is not any different from any other kind of derivatives transaction. The Transaction is still defined as the purchase and sale of the underlying even if it is cash settled. It is defined as the swap of the fixed price for the current market price. Would define a reference price for the current market price if it's not a physical settlement. Would for example define the use of a calculation agent. Scenarios: 1. Agree to cash settle even though the underlying is a deliverable 2. Agree to settle cash because it's difficult to get hold of the underlying 3. The underlying is by its nature not deliverable 4. Fx where the deliverable is a currency to cash delivery is synonymous with delivery of the underlying asset, so the underlying observable and the underlying deliverable are the same actual thing. How this is modeled: Cash \"Settlement\" (means cash delivery) is where you take cash instad of delivery of the underlying deliverable. Whatever is going to be delivered there is going to be a reverse transaction at the going market rate. That also covers the use of an index or basket as the underlying. Examples of this: IR Swap - not an Option."	rel:definition	1

variance leg terms	"A return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. Variance of a single price (over time - how is this modeled? Is this the duration of the contract or some defined period or poeriods of time). The variance gets its time basis from the negotiated period in the contract, e.g. Variance over 3 months. Check: Is this always the duration of the contract or can it be for example a set of time scales (say monthly) ove the life of say a 6 month contract, and take an average?? This is logically possible but we don't know if this is what this is. FpML: A type describing return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. More notes 17 Mar Varianc v covariance Variance is a surrogate for option. Talks about random fluctuation in prices If you look at options theory (black scholes) then the price of an option is 1rily dependent in variation in the price. The more variable the more expensive ot maintain a portfolio that is indifferent to the next move in price. So this Variance Swap allows you to extract that option price (i.e. the variance as above) into the variability of the underlying price. So then the asset being traded is in fact the asset that the price references. context: This is all about controlling the price of an asset (from the point of view of the portfolio holder). similarly with the variance on an index you are picking up on the generic market stability. Recall that an index is controlling an underlying portfolio, but with the index you talk directly about the price (in an index swap), this gives you control of a portfolio that is represented by that index. Basket Swap is this - difference is agreed basket (Index, which has a publisher) versus Basket where the \"index\" (we don't call it that here) is a basket of securities."	rel:definition	1

credit facility	"We now have it that all loans follow from a CommittedCredit Facility, but this may be transient. See notes on fees and Ts and Cs. See also FpML terms and elements on this. Apply to loan, draw-down generally (money market loan where we only see the actual lending). Is there also this feature in Money Markets, if you go straight to the market and they assess you on the spot? They have simply done the same kind of assessment. So maybe the concept of transient Cr facility tranche does not apply in that instance. There need be no firm commitment until the instrument is bought off you, at which point you have the capital. So this is where money markets and loans part company. Lending departments: create facility Money markets: deliver the money."	rel:editorialNote	1
credit facility	"There may also be min and max parcels of these. May also be fees for this facility. Review Questions and Discussion: QUESTION: Are there significant meaningful differences between retail and corporate? In the corporate world you may sit down and make an agreement between the lender and the potential borrower, to agreement. Corporate: Committed lending v Uncommitted lending. Sets limits what they are prepared to lend to a customer but don't make an agreement with the customer. Separately: May go into a \"Specified Commitment\" to make that lending. We say to the customer we are prepared to lend you x amount and of that, we will say, that eg 100M can be drawn down in this way, e.g as a direct loan, another 100M may be in terms of guarantees offered. May also put a lot of structure around how that may be drawn. Project financing / construction finance is where we have limits about this. You are constructing your own collateral in the construction. The collateral is an agreement where you may size these assets in the event of a default. Collateral may be associatedd irectly with the loan OR directly with the Facility. In the latter case you would not have to renegotiate collateral agreements every time you draw down on that loan. How this works: The Credit Facility in this latter case, is a bilateral contract: The lender is legally committing to be able to extend that amount of money. Borrower can borrow (or not) as and when they see fit. The lender has to then set aside capital for that money. It is now the borrower's right to determine when and how they draw this. So the central facility says we would do those loans - within the context for that facility. In retail:: there is no flexibility to negotiate, the Ts & Cs are fairly standard. All the above concepts still exist in retail. So bank has limit they are prepared to lend that customer., determined in the context of the amount of collateral the retail customer can provide. Can still have construction loans in retail lending. See also syndicated loans. Set up with panel of potential vendors."	rel:editorialNote	1

Added as synonym Modeling note: Note that some of these are simple \"Yes/no\" conditions i.e. the event has happened or it has not. Others comprise more detailed information. However, 4 of those that are given as \"yes/no\" in FpML do in fact have the additional fact of Default Requirement. So almost none are simple yes/no or list entry terms. Modeled accordingly. Note also that the term Credit Event is defined more widely than just in CDS, for example in credit indices or just as business events generally. Therefore some of the CDS-specific terms here won't apply in those other contexts. Review comment: 22 styles of ISDA agreements for CDS as well, with different combinations of terms.

See also shelf registration (issuing bond before you file the paperwork with e.g. SEC - not the same). In this case it is registered but not issued all at one time. Flexible.

For instance an option to exercise which would give another 5 percent control. So there is percentage control with or without share ownership. Example: In a partnership this might be in the Partnership Agreement, which would identify beneficial ownership and control as potentially 2 distinct things. Contract can say anything. Implications: This means that there are percentages of de jure control based in contract, similar to those based in constitutional instruments (shares, General Partner equity). The concepts of Parent, Siinificant Part Owner etc. can then potentially be defined int erms of the percentages of all applicable instruments by which control may be formally defined."	rel:editorialNote	1

credit facility tranche	"The amount of each tranche of the credit facility sums to the total Credit Facility amount. Tranches of the Credit Facility each have a stated purpose. Credit Facility may includes provision of loans, of guarantees, credit finance and other things that can create a credit exposure. Scope of Credit Facility Tranches: Many tranches are for loans. For retail borrowers these would be the only types of tranche. For other types of potential borrowers e.g. corporates, other tranches of credit facility may include for securitized debt (where the potential borrower is a corporation), or for guaranty provision. (detailed note from SME Review 10 Feb 2011) Credit Facility may also have provision of guarantees, credit finance and other things that can create a credit exposure. These are all in the Credit Facility Tranche. Sets terms under which the lender may make a number of tns which may create the redit risk. The tranche may be the creation of the credit risk See also CDO, where the Pf is structured in a way that might then be subject to these considerations. Not the same meaning as Tranches in CDOs. (note ends) PoC (2010) notes (specific to Loan trahche) Note that since this time the scope of these has been extended since credit facility is also relevant to securitized debt, and other cretid exposures (guaranty etc.). The amount of each tranche, summed up. makes up the Credit Facillity amount. Each tranche has a loan type. One or more loans are issued against this transhe Against the loan will be one or more draw downs. Example: Take a tranche for Credit Line. This is $300K. against that $300K tranche, I issue a credit line loan of $200K . Against that loan of $200K I may draw $10K An amount you are good for under agreed termas and conditions. A credit line is not necessarily going to be drawn. Drawn is the Current debt obligation and may change from day to day. Simpler example: Construction Loan Credit Facility of $1M for this person Against a tranche of Construction Loan, I can have $300 tranche of credit facility. NOT A LOAN. Against that tranche of $300K I can create a loan (take a loan) for Construction, of $200K. That loan is also going to be advanced in several draw-downs. Once I complete the 1st phase of construction, for example at the start I get an initial 10$ for a draw of 15K, then after the 1st phase I get a draw of another 15% and so on. That is where debt and loan differ because the debt is what you are paying interest on (the outstanding balance) which reflects a cumulative sum of draw minus any principal repayments. The difference between these is to be explained at a future session. A given tranche will observe all of the requirements of a credit facility. It has additional requirements. So a Credit Facility has multiple tranches. It does not inherit Amount. Credit Facility Amounts are distinct from Tranche Amount. 14 July: Credit Faciliy versus Committed Credit Facility. Recall that a non committe credit facility implies no commitment on the part of the potential lender. Once they are committed to it, that's a contractual commitment. However, before they do that, they assess your credit (and/or collateral or other forms of interest). What happens as time goes along? There are Ts and Cs in the facility, including a termination date (and general temrination clauses). Are there general termination clauses for instance for changes to circumstances? there is an Evergreen concept, whereby the(potential) lender has the right to revise the Ts and Cs, and terminate the loan, on a given, pre-stated review date. So the Evergreen term has conditions about what happens to outstanding loans and so on. the bank will structure lending to be able to get out as required, for example the loan may not go on beyond the Evergreen review date. This is not hard and fast though - the proviedr of the facility manages this and decides accordingly. May noe be all that obvious to the borrower what happens. Meanwhile, with revolving facility there is by definitoin a review date. Modeling: Add these (Evergreen) etc. terms to the terms for the committed credit facility. There might be conditions in the lending agreement that say how we will handle that. Are there terms i nthe Loan contract itself that refer back tot hese? Yes. The Loan Documentation will reference the Credit Facility. Compare with ISDA Master Agreement. Are there also Termination clases based on default events? (as per ISDA MA)? Most likely. These will be defined in the loan agreement. The pre-agreed terms, these are the Conditions Precedent (see elsewhere in the model) The Conditions Precedent are those things that have ot happen before the loan comes into play, for example stumping up collaterial, setting up ESCROW accounts and that kind of thing, that have to happen before the FACILITY comes into existence. So there are Conditions Precedent to the Facility, and Conditions Presedent to the Loan. So for instance negative pledges etc. - during the life of the loan you would have to confirm that you are in compliance with the conditions in the NEgative Pledge agreement. These will be Conditions Subsequent. Are there \"Conditions Precedent\" to the loan itself? Seemingly not. The loan is committed. for a non committed Credit Facility (e.g. general loan, auto loan, mortgage, lent to individuals), there are no Conditions Precedent because the bank either agrees the loan or they do not. Even for a single up front loan, there is in principle a Credit Facility which is immediately drawn down. So during that initial (intra day) period of time, there is a committed credit facility. So there is always a committed Credit Facility even if it's only transient before it is drawn down. So Credit Facility may be committed or not. but all loan are drawn down from Committed Credit Facility, even if that commitment is only transient i.e. the loan is dranw down right away. In this case, the commitment is discharged right away as a draw down. So the existence of a fee, only applies to committed credit facility tranches which are not transient. The \"fees\" as such are embedded in the interest rate. Whatever costs are incurred are passed right through as interest rate. Whereas, with credit facilitie that exist for a time, there are additional costs, and these are passed on as fees. This is the logic of having \"undrawn fees\". Example: Overdraft facility has a fee, which even if you don't use the overdraft, they charge you an undrawn fee. At the bank's discretion they might not charge fo rhtis, but recover the costs elsewhere. They may also have restrictions on whether you can have it there unused and so on. Modeling: Can construct almost any of these in whatever combination. So make sure that the model bears this out. So going into the Credit Facility is: - credit checking - Collateral - Security Interest as a general term these are, in common, all \"Credit Control\" or credit min=tigation features. Guaranties are another. CDS is also a form of guaranty, where someone guarantees that the other party will pay. Or it may take the form of some ownership transfer (?) Default: activates a Credit Support Agreement. Default event triggers the credit support agreement between the lender and the potential borrower (or a third party - see Guaranty), describing what the borrower (por other party) says the lender can do in the event of default. See Credit Support Agreements as a whole - we should model these. Also relates to the posting of collateral in OTC swaps and the like. This is also where central counterparties provide a mechanism for centralizing the risk of these. The central agency is holding the securities that each party has posted in their Master Agreement with the central counterparty (e.g. clearing house). Guaranties create contagion."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

debt finance	"Funds loaned or extended from one party to another for some purpose. Further notes: This is a loan or a debt security principal amount. This term is distinguished from \"Debt\" or \"Credit\" in that the latter are balances at a point in time; however it is also referred to as debt for example in debt securities, since a loaned or securitized amount constitutes a debt when it is advanced (and ceases to constitute a debt when it is paid off). As such, this usually has interest payable and may have collateral. In Islamic products there is no interest. This may be a loan (realized as a draw-down on a credit facillity) or it may be a debt set up as part of the issuance of a debt security."	rel:definition	1

certificate of deposit	"Small denomination certificates of deposit are issued to retail investors. In the United States, these usually are covered by deposit insurance. A certificate of deposit has a fixed term. At the end of the term, the deposit is returned with interest. The vast majority of certificates of deposit have terms of under a year, with three months being typical. Certificates of deposit with terms of a year or more are called term CDs. Terms of five years are not unheard of. Most certificates of deposit credit a fixed rate of interest, but there are also floating-rate certificates of deposit. A fee must be paid to withdraw funds early. This is called a CD interest penalty or a withdrawal penalty. Because most certificates of deposit are negotiable, investors usually sell an unwanted certificate of deposit rather than pay a fee and withdraw the funds. To facilitate transferability, most certificates of deposit are issued in bearer form, but some are registered. Can be interest at maturity or it can be periodic payments."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

A third feature, \"Knock In Knock Out\" is really two of these and is represented as such in the Option terms i.e. there may be two of this Option Feature Terms term. The term \"Barrier Option\" applies to both of these, i.e. Knock In and Knock Out are types of Barrier Option. An option contract may or may not have a barrier option. If it does not, none of this applies. Others: knock in a knock out, knock in a digitale, if it exceeds one barrier you get a call; for another you get a put, and so on."	rel:editorialNote	1

frn date rule	"FpML definition: \"Per 2000 ISDA Definitions, Section 4.11, FRN Convention, Eurodollar Convention.\" The above definition is from FpML and does not give the meaning or nature of this rule. FpML notes that this is not strictly a Date Roll Rule (but it may be selected in place of one). On inspection of the ISDA 2000 definition text, this may be because the FRN rule contains within it a specification of the Modified Following date roll rule (Date following rule modified by Modification rule). This rule appears in FpML both in the BusinessDayConventionEnum and the RollConventionEnum (for date roll rules and for scheduled event dates respectively). From FpML definition for BusinessDayConventionEnum: \"... Note that FRN is included here as a type of business day convention although it does not strictly fall within ISDA's definition of a Business Day Convention and does not conform to the simple definition given above.\" Note that this FRN rule is also included in the FpML enumeration for \"RollConventionEnum\". This is the enumeration of possible Calculation Period End Dates and uses the word \"Roll\" in a completely different sense (the date that the application of some calculation to some amount is rolled over from one rate to the next). Full definition from ISDA 2000 Section 4.11: Section 4.11. FRN Convention; Eurodollar Convention. \"FRN Convention\" or \"Eurodollar Convention\" means, in respect of either Payment Dates or Period End Dates for a Swap Transaction and a party, that the Payment Dates or Period End Dates of that party will be each day during the Term of the Swap Transaction that numerically corresponds to the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party in the calendar month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date occurred (or, in the case of the first applicable Payment Date or the Period End Date, the day that numerically corresponds to the Effective Date in the calendar month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the Effective Date occurred), except that (a) if there is not any such numerically corresponding day in the calendar month in which a Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party should occur, then the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the last day that is a Business Day in that month, (b) if a Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of the party would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, then the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the first following day that is a Business Day unless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the first preceding day that is a Business Day and (c) if the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party occurred on the last day in a calendar month that was a Business Day, then all subsequent applicable Payment Dates or Period End Dates, as the case may be, of that party prior to the Termination Date will be the last day that is a Business Day in the month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date occurred."	rel:editorialNote	1

So you write a contract and give it to the ringleader, who then books it. So the party you dealt with deals with the exahcnge, and you deal with the exchange. THen there are two contracts for one deal. So the answer here is that there are two novated contracts for one Options deal. Difference: If not open outcry? In OO the deal is done and given to the ringleader, who represents the Cleaing house. When it's not open outcry, the clearing house gets the deal, books the deal, and margins it. So you don't know as much about the deal and process. This eliminiates stickiness of a market that has credit.

Trading in these contracts is governed in the U.S. by the federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Traders use these futures to speculate on the direction of interest rates.

mortgage indemnity guaranty	"See notes from SME Review and in MIG Provider. Applies to securitized pool, insures the lender. Additional note (IBM): there is a further application of this. When a lender takes a loan which is a where the value of the loan is greater than 80% of the value of the property, at that point it is required for the lender to also get a private mortgage insurance, so they are paying separately for the mortgage insurance so that if the borrower defaults above 80% then the mortgage insurance pays the loss. In the Loan Party Insurer (new \"Party\" type) you have Loan Party Insured Ratio (e.g. the 80% in the example above). These are different situations but the same principle. So this needs to be modeled for both. 30 June: Is this Lender or Borrower? since you have one lender and one borrower in a single loan, but multiple lenders in the case of packaging this up for a security - there are then multiple lenders and multiple borrowers. A similar kind of insurance exists in the one lender one borrower scenario i.e. the mortgage loan itself. There are two concepts here. the MIG thing was for bundling these. the MIG might apply across multiple contracts, but still be a fact about \"the\" contract? The notes about 80% above (IBM) are about the individual loan. ACTION: Tidy this up."	rel:editorialNote	1

While is is common to speak of the corporation as the issuer of the ABS, legally, it is the trust or special purpose vehicle that is the issuer. It sells securities to investors. To protect investors from possible bankruptcy of the corporation, there are three legal safeguards: - Transfer of assets from the corporation is a non-recourse, true sale. - Investors receive a perfected interest in the assets' cash flows. - A non-consolidation legal opinion is obtained certifying that assets of the trust or special purpose vehicle cannot be consolidated with the corporation's assets in the event of bankruptcy. These same safeguards allow the corporation to remove the assets from its balance sheet. The corporation generally continues to service the assets - collecting interest and principal payments, pursuing delinquencies, etc. It is paid out of asset cash flows for providing these ongoing services."	rel:definition	1

equity forward seller	"The forward is always written by the party that is committing to sell the underlying, and is always bought by the party that is committing to take delivery of the underlying on the settlement date. The forward contract is the same as a conventional secondary market sale transaction but with the difference that the settlement date is in the future. See 2000 ISDA definitions Article 11.1 (a). FpML: 'A reference to the party that sells (\"writes\") this instrument, i.e. that grants the rights defined by this instrument and in return receives a payment for it. See 2000 ISDA definitions Article 11.1 (a). In the case of FRAs this is the floating rate payer.'

credit protection contingent leg terms	"Review notes 31 March: For a protection leg the commitment is a conditional commitment to pay out in the event of the credit event. Typically this would be a default. Contingent Leg is another name for this, because it is contingent on the credit event. Contents: 1. The payment to be made in the event of the credit event occurring 2. the Credit Event itself. This is called the calculation amount as it is the notional amount minus the recovery, to get a final calculation amount. There is a formula behind this. The Calculation Amount is how the calculation is driven not what the actual payment amount is. Do we model the formula? Depends whether there is physical or cash settlement. Modeler notes: FpML terms for \"CDS Protection Terms\" are equivalent to this structure. Formal Definition for CDS Protection Terms: The legal terms relevant to defining the applicable floating rate payer calculation amount, credit events and associated conditions to settlement, and reference obligations. FpML: 'This element contains all the terms relevant to defining the applicable floating rate payer calculation amount, credit events and associated conditions to settlement, and reference obligations.'

underlier	"The underlier breaks down into two separate meanings: The item which determines the value of the contract (the observable), and the item that is deliverable upon expiry or exercise of the contract (if there is one). These are usually the same item but in some cases such as index derivatives the exercise takes a different form. Action: Add 'Observable' as a distinct term. Then use Deliverable. Is Underlier the union? In a Call Option the Underlier is the Deliverable and is referred to as the Underlier. With an Fx Call Option, the deliverable is the cash value which you are exchanging for the amount in another currency (so this is no difference as cash is instrument). Then take IR Swap where 3mo LIBOR Rate is the Observable, but the delivery is Cash. Then one would refer to the LIBOR as the Observable. Delivers an amount based on the observable, and the delivered cash is the Deliverable. So what we refer to as Underlier may be the Observable or the Deliverable e.g. Call option on IBM the deliverable is the IBM Stock whereas a Swap leg depending on LIBOR, the Deliverable is Cash but the 'Underlier' is the Observable. Would be nore accurate not to refer to the Observable not as an Underlier. Therefore there would be nothing referred to as the 'Underlier' as such. However, all derivatives have Underlier. Take an IR Cap, would not not refer to it as having an Underlier - the notion of Underlier becomes fuzzier when you get to higher order derivatives. LIBOR on a list of dates is an 'Observable' but is several amounts."	rel:editorialNote	1

dividend conditions	"FpML has a set of terms for Dividend Conditions which are usable across a range of derivatives, including Forward. Many of the definitions of individual terms refer specifically to equity return (swaps) and it is not clear whether each such term also applies to Equity forwards (i.e. the definition is more specific than it should be), or if these are terms unique to Equity Return Swaps, among which are terms applicable to Equity forwards. REVIEW: 19 May: If you have a forward contract with a dividend before you settle there must be some terms to determine how the dividend is resolved. Similar question would apply with Bond Interst? No becaues this is a known amount so it is taken into account in the price that's been agreed (discount premium). Whether it's cum or ex coupon therefore doesn't affect pricing; with Dividend this is not the case, there afore there are contractual trerms about how that is to be resolved.

instrument weighted average loan age	"This is defined by the issuer. WALA is more official, not an analysis from a vendor. This changes but the values are relayed by the issuer on an ongoing basis. Investopedia explains Weighted Average Loan Age - WALA The weighted average age will change over time as some mortgages get paid off faster than others. Based on the issuer of the mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the WALA may be weighted on the remaining principal balance dollar figure, or the beginning notional value of the loan. The flip side of the WALA is the weighted average maturity (WAM), which is a dollar-weighted measure of the months remaining until the principal amounts are completely repaid on each loan in the pool."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1

See: Loan borrower Association (the action term) Proposal: Use the entity of Contract (specialized for loan contracts). Rationale: Most of these terms are similar to those for a Bond, which is a securitry and as such is a Contract. Would then identify facts about the contract as a contract e.g. maturity) and also sets of contractual terms such as interst payment trerms and principal repayment terms. Conclusion: modeled this as a Contract. Extensively re-built the archetypal \"Debt\" model to distinguish between Debt (an amount owed) and Debt Finance (an amount extended by one party to another at a point in time, which is then a debt). Original notes from PoC: Unique identifier for each loan. The loan ID should not change through the life of the transaction. If the original loan ID canot be maintained in this field enter the original ID followed by the new ID, comma delimited ( We handle this as an attribute of mortgage loan rether than loan - since ensuring uniqueness and stability will be handled across the class of mortgage loans before attempting this across any broader class of general loans )"	rel:editorialNote	1

cdo note	"Collateralized Debt Obligation. This is a type of asset-backed security and is constructed from a portfolio of fixed income assets including corporate loans and mortgage backed securities. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) issues notes to investors in order to raise funds that are invested in a portfolio of those fixed income assets, held by the SPV as collateral for the notes. Further notes: Collateralized Debt Obligation, for example, ABS CDO which consists of a portfolio of different ABS bonds, and the payments to the holders of these trust certificates are derived from the cash flows of the ABS bonds. This CDO instrument is part of a CDO issue, consisting of individual CDO instruments of a given seniority. Often referred to as tranches and slices (Investopedia). Investopedia: Similar in structure to a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO), CDOs are unique in that they represent different types of debt and credit risk. In the case of CDOs, these different types of debt are often referred to as 'tranches' or 'slices'. Each slice has a different maturity and risk associated with it. The higher the risk, the more the CDO pays. Further details: Collateralized Debt obligations are securitized interests in pools of - generally non-mortgage - assets. Assets - called collateral - usually comprise loans or debt instruments. A CDO may be called a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO) if it holds only loans or bonds, respectively. Investors bear the credit risk of the collateral. Multiple tranches of securities are issued by the CDO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics."	rel:definition	1

The body of precedent is called common law and it binds future decisions. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a matter of first impression), judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating precedent.

unilateral contract	"In a unilateral, or one-sided, contract, one party, known as the offeror, makes a promise in exchange for an act (or abstention from acting) by another party, known as the offeree. If the offeree acts on the offeror's promise, the offeror is legally obligated to fulfill the contract, but an offeree cannot be forced to act (or not act), because no return promise has been made to the offeror. After an offeree has performed, only one enforceable promise exists, that of the offeror.\n\nA unilateral contract differs from a Bilateral Contract, in which the parties exchange mutual promises. Bilateral contracts are commonly used in business transactions; a sale of goods is a type of bilateral contract."	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1
