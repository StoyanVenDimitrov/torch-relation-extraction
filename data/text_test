balance	raw text	method	doc	15	16	2	3	– Transaction method The transaction method records all sales and purchases of items held on balance sheets at the start and/or end of a reporting period, and also transactions reversed within the reference period.																																		
balance	raw text	method	doc	19	20	1	2	This method, however, may make it difficult to relate recorded transactions in some categories to developments in reporting MFIs’ balance sheets.																																		
balance	raw text	portfolio	doc	23	24	29	30	This is because recorded transactions will include purchases that are reversed during the period, whose effects are thus not visible in the end-of-month balance sheet positions for the securities portfolio.																																		
balance	raw text	value	doc	19	20	36	37	Moreover, transactions may be valued at different prices from those at which the relevant securities are valued on the balance sheet (where they do indeed appear on the balance sheet), since MFIs report transactions at transaction value, but will still follow national practice in valuing securities when it comes to balance sheet outstandings.																																		
balance	raw text	method	doc	1	2	3	4	– Balance sheet method The balance sheet method records all sales and purchases of items held on balance sheets at the start and/or end of a reporting period, but not the purchases reversed within the reference period.																																		
balance	raw text	price	doc	2	3	33	34	Under the balance sheet method, the sale during the month of any securities held on the balance sheet at the end of the previous month is deemed to have taken place at the price at which the securities were recorded on the previous month’s balance sheet, irrespective of the price at which the sale actually took place.																																		
balance	raw text	price	doc	12	13	29	30	Similarly, the purchase during the month of any securities retained on the balance sheet at the end of the current month is deemed to have taken place at the price at which the securities are recorded on the current month’s balance sheet.

balance	raw text	value	doc	34	35	26	27	The lack of harmonisation of valuation rules across the euro area and the fact that even the same reporting institution may use different valuation rules to value different portfolios supports the use of the balance sheet method, which gives a closer link between statistics on outstanding amounts and transactions and is thus a better basis for calculating growth rates reflecting only transactions with an impact on end-of-period stocks.																																		
balance	raw text	method	doc	2	3	4	5	However, the balance sheet method omits an important element of transactions, namely those undertaken and reversed during the reference period, and accordingly departs from the definition of transactions in the ESA 95, leading to possible inconsistencies with other statistics.																																		
balance	raw text	value	doc	25	26	38	39	In particular, while the revaluation adjustments implied by the transaction method are conceptually equivalent to (realised and unrealised) gains/ losses on holdings of securities, the balance sheet method delivers revaluation adjustments that cover the changes in the carrying value of securities held throughout the reference period only.																																		
balance	raw text	method	doc	22	23	24	25	The higher the turnover in securities, the larger the number of purchases reversed within the reference period that are omitted under the balance sheet method.

balance	raw text	revaluation	doc	31	32	12	13	When MFIs record transactions directly and report these to NCBs, NCBs derive revaluation adjustments to be transmitted (on an aggregated basis) to the ECB as a residual from the change in balance sheet outstandings corrected for the impact of reclassifications and other volume changes,30 and from reported transactions.																																		
balance	raw text	security	doc	24	25	20	21	As discussed above, the revaluation adjustments indirectly obtained under the transaction method equal the (realised and unrealised) gains/losses on the security holdings, while the balance sheet method would only cover the change in carrying value of securities held throughout the period.																																		
balance	raw text	price	doc	39	40	18	19	Where transactions in securities are not reported by MFIs, Regulation ECB/2008/32 requires MFIs instead to provide data on price revaluation adjustments, intended to capture the price-related effects on the outstanding amounts of their holdings of securities recorded on the balance sheet.

balance	raw text	revaluation	doc	33	34	11	12	Regulation ECB/2008/32 does not, however, prescribe how reporting agents should calculate revaluation adjustments on holdings of securities: what matters is that they should be consistent with the valuation applied to securities on the balance sheet.

balance	raw text	issued	doc	62	63	15	16	Furthermore, if the originating MFI, or the MFI sector as a whole, purchases the securities issued by the FVC acquiring the loans, it will appear (if the loans are mortgage or consumer credit loans, or loans to non-financial businesses) that there has been a switch from lending to households/non-financial corporations to credit to other financial intermediaries, which, although correct if the MFI balance sheet is considered in isolation, does not capture the economic reality of what has happened.																																		
balance	raw text	partner	doc	13	14	38	39	For various reasons, therefore, the information on the assets side of an MFI’s balance sheet needs to be supplemented, either by further information on its securitisation activities, which can be provided by the MFI itself, or by the partner FVC taking on the loans or assuming the credit risk, or some combination of the two.																																		
balance	raw text	holding	doc	17	18	26	27	Since synthetic securitisation is of no consequence from this perspective, because the loans remain on the originator’s balance sheet and the FVC does not record a holding of loans, the MFI balance sheet reporting does not contain special reporting requirements for synthetic securitisation (though, of course, any deposits placed by the FVC involved with the MFI in a synthetic securitisation as well as any FVC securities held by the MFI are included in the respective positions on the MFI balance sheet).

balance	raw text	credit risk	doc	16	17	31	57	This is reflected in the requirement that all securitisation transactions are to be recorded for MFI balance sheet statistics, while, according to Annex IX, Part 2 of Directive 2006/48/EC, the originating credit institution engaging in a traditional securitisation may exclude securitised exposures from the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts and expected loss amounts if significant credit risk associated with the securitised exposures has been transferred to third parties.27 A further point to underline relates to the coverage of securitisation transactions under the two reporting frameworks.																																		
balance	raw text	risk	doc	3	4	54	55	In contrast, MFI balance sheet statistics do not cover synthetic securitisation, as this has no impact on outstanding amounts of credit.28 Moreover, securitisation transactions are disclosed for supervisory purposes whether or not they are set up using a securitisation special purpose entity (SSPE) because of the importance for prudential purposes of recording transfers of risk which in turn affect capital requirements.

price	raw text	revaluation	doc	4	5	5	6	It thus follows that price revaluation statistics obtained by residual under direct derivation of transactions with the transaction method are conceptually equivalent to the gains/losses on MFIs’ security holdings during the reference period.1 If transactions are derived using the balance sheet method, however, the derivation yields different results, as the purchases that are reversed during the period are not taken into account and the values at which securities are recorded on the balance sheet are all that matters for the valuation of sales and purchases.
