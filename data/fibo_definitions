debt convexity analytic	The second derivative of a security's price with respect to its yield, divided by the security's price. A security exhibits positive convexity when its price rises more for a downward move in its yield than its price declines for an equal upward move in its yield. Further notes: A measure of the change in price for a given change in Modified Duration. This always (necessarily) refers to Modified Duration. This is used as another risk measurement. Numerator is always (a) duration - either MacCaulays or Modified. Always rate of change of (one of the) Duration against some other parameter. The other paramater can be characterised as a Yield (it may be the Price, but that has a relationship to the Yield in any case). REVIEW: Inconsistency in the above - is it always necessarily Modified Duration that is referred to, or \"any\" Duration measure (Macaulays and.or Modified)? notes 9 Dec A measure of the sensitivity of the price with reference to interest rates. This is normally determined with reference to maturity, but since there are different maturity dates, this figure gives an estimate of the equitvalent if you had a homogenous portfolio, i.e. this is an estimate based on a pure equivalent, homogenous portfolio. Convexity of instrument versus portfolio. Sees instrument in terms of the set of cashflows. The term Convexity can be applied either to a bond or to a portfolio. More notes: When you get Convexit in MD, it will tell you what Duration it is refrfering to, along with Redemption Date (logically). Also if there is Option Adjusted Yield, there is a third set of analytics. What are they? i.e. OA Convexity, Duration Yield and the rest. Conclusions: Agreed to revisit this in OTC.	rel:definition	1

lender right	Rights on the lender to protect them against loss. furthe rNtoes: Logically, considering the two parties, they both have protecxtion mechanisms. so while the lender has protecxtion mechanisms through mortgage insurance, and the consumer has protextion mechanisms such as good faith estimates. also the agencies (see Consumer Protection Agency), an instance of which is the CFPB in the US (just set up). Lender rights are: - expressed in the Contract Consumer protection develops becaues the contract is written by the potential Lender. So the rights are introcued to rectify the imbalance between the two parties. Same goes for insurance. consumer protection laws (governe dby the relevant consumer protection agency. So the lender protexts itself as it writes th contract AND does the things it needs to do to protext itself, but on the approval process, and with later instruments such as insurance. Interestingly., it is the Borrower who pays for this by paying for credit reports etc. So the borrower protects itself by other mechanisms. Caveat emptor - displaced by regulation (the buyer is protected by regulation). Uberimae Fidae - in the utmost good faith. Mortgage Insurance is an additional means of mitigating the risk, that the lended may have., so if the information assessed is not accurate, or if the borrower's situation changes for the worse. then the risk rating may go down. So the Mortgage Insurance is a further strategy which mitigates any shortfall in the Lender Righrs that you may have - ie someone guarantees. In the US you can also avoid that by having paid a deposit. PIMI: Principal, Interst and Morgage Insurance. So the Borrower pays towards the MI, esxcept if they have paid a given amount as deposit. there are 2 types of MI: 1. protects the lender in the event of borrower degault 2. Insurance for \"Incapacity to pay the mortage\" (these can be bought off the shelf - can combine health, unemployment etc.). - this is the Borrower mitigating their own risk. Prevents foreclosure. Similar to general sickness etc. Where the lender charges for MI, the cost is passed onto the Borrower. e.g. if there is a % valuation (e.g. 70% in Aus, 80% in US for example) then no insurance is required.	rel:definition	1

dutch auction	"The party to which the offer is made need not be the holder. Details: Question on \""Who is the actor?\"" Dutch auction would have multiple parties? What is the scenario? Usually happens when a company is about to go into administration. Looking at the scneario descried in the SWIFT definition - not clear if this is the only such scenario. Possibly the issuer has to notif ythe shareholders that the offer is being made. The offer is made by the third party but the notice is sent by the issuer (via their agent) and via the registrar who holds the details of who holds all the shares. Example: Lloyds banking group - most shares would be owned by the market, and a small percentage might be held by private investors. So in this scenario everyone has to be given the opportunity to sell at the given price. so the CAE message is still issued by the Issuer. SWIFT detailed names (synonym?) \""Dutch Auction, Bid Tender\""	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1
dutch auction	""Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is an action by a party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. UPDATE THIS DEFINITION: Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is the result of an action by a third party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited (and given a message by the issuer) to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. OR It might also represent a separate scenario where third parties do this, as per the original SWIFT defition. You can only go to the Registrar which would the other scenario impossible. Agents and Registrars: The issue issuer os the company which issued the shares (as modeled); Most companies don't interact directly with the market to find out who they need to disseminate the info to. They can, but more likely the employ \""Issuers Agent\"". That provides one point of contact from the organization. That agent handles all coms with the Registrars, and to the news wires etc., to disseminate the corporate action. Context: CAE only, or in the context of the Issue? When you issue the security you nominate an Agent, in the prospectus, there is specified an Issuing Agent. This is the one that does these things. Usually a merchant bank etc. in the old days. This is who will have directly facilitated that direct market engagement. Next question: This is part of going public, so these agents are appointed as part of going public."	rel:definition	1

Once you get into the default scenario we are talking about a proces that is going to fall into place over a period of time. The bank works out what to do with the default scenario, e.g. whether it restructures, forecloses, seeks restitution from the security (collateral). It does nto help us to understand the structure of the loan, rather tha consequences of the loan. If we were to further explore the default detail we would bring in other SMEs. And we would have to model a process flow. 1.1 impact on the pool of an MBS Loan Default Proceeding (special ase of legal thing) is an aspect of Default Management / Administratoin. there is also the State of the Loan.

future instrument	Agreement to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity, a currency or a financial instrument at a particular price on a stipulated future date. A futures contract obligates the buyer to purchase the underlying commodity, currency or financial instrument and the seller to sell it unless the contract is sold to another before settlement date which may happen if a trader waits to take a profit or cut a loss. Further notes: This contrasts with options trading in which the option buyer may choose whether or not to exercise the option by the exercise date. Unlike options, futures convey an obligation to buy. The risk to the holder is unlimited, and because the payoff pattern is symmetrical, the risk to the seller is unlimited as well. Dollars lost and gained by each party on a futures contract are equal and opposite. In other words, futures trading is a zero-sum game. Futures contracts are forward contracts, meaning they represent a pledge to make a certain transaction at a future date. The exchange of assets occurs on the date specified in the contract. Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, trade on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by clearinghouses. Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily. Finally, by making an offsetting trade, taking delivery of goods, or arranging for an exchange of goods, futures contracts can be closed. Hedgers often trade futures for the purpose of keeping price risk in check. Definition origin: Barrons, adapted by EDMC SMER.	rel:definition	1

Now to change the capital base, there are two directions, up or down. Bonus issue falls into the above because you are increasing the capital base. A rights issue also increateses the capital base.

draft	A draft is a legally binding order by one party (the drawer) to a second party (the drawee) to make payment to a third party (the payee). A simple example is a bank check -which is simply an order directing a bank to pay a third party. The three parties don't have to be distinct. For example, someone might write himself a check as a simple means of transferring funds from one bank account to another. In this case, the drawer and payee are the same person. When a draft guarantees payment for goods in international trade, it is called a bill of exchange. A draft can require immediate payment by the second party to the third upon presentation of the draft. This is called a sight draft. Checks are sight drafts. In trade, drafts often are for deferred payment. An importer might write a draft promising payment to an exporter for delivery of goods with payment to occur 60 days after the goods are delivered. Such drafts are called time drafts. They are said to mature on the payment date. In this example, the importer is both the drawer and the drawee. Definition source: riskglossary.com	rel:definition	1

construction loan credit facility tranche	A loan taken out for construction purposes. Further notes: These are a temporary loan. when the construction is finished then that loan is transformed to another loan, which would be a permanent loan. Information to follow on what the new permanent loan would be. Terms are adjusted in the new loan, since in construction loans the rates are significantly higher. This is an incentive to complete the construction works. Notes from PoC reviews, discussing Maximum Balance concept: In a Construction Loan you agree a maximum amount that you could draw. As you progress with the construction you continue to draw more and more. So you start with the minimum. Example: for purpose of construction of a house you could need to borrow up to 500K and the bank establishes the milestones at which certain amounts are made availalbe and can be drawn. For instance prior to start you might draw 10%, (50K); the next 50K would be available to draw only once the foundations are laid. And so on. Milestones may include \"Frame standing\" (for American-style frame based houses). Each stage requires inspection on behalf of the bank. So you are starting with no more than 10% (in this example) of what is allowable, and could arrive to the full 500K by the end of ths construction but it is not mandated that you arrive to that. What differentiates a Construction Loan is that there si a max amount specified and there are Milestones specified in which the amounts for each milestone can be advanced.	rel:definition	1

cap determination	The Strike rate is to be subtracted from the Observable rate on the reset date, to determine the settlement amount. This is incorrect. Cap applies to borrower. the Cap is the max amount I will pay to borrow. I take a capped rate. I am the buyer of the option. The market rate this time is higher than the capped rate. You as the seller of the option will pay me thedifference bwteen the capped rate and the market reate. If the market rate is lower than the capped rate no one pays anything because I will not exercise my right to that capped rate. So no money changes hands at settlement. Then: capped Loan: What I would be paying would be interest at the market rate if the market rate is lower, but if the market rate is higher then I would pay interest at the capped rate. This is the difference between a cap as a loan or as a cash settled thing. These represent different kinds of contract: Non loan one: Cap talks of settlement being difference between the market rate and the strike rate. This is cash settled. Name: \"Cap\" Loan one: Cap talks about a maximum interest rate payable by the holder, so the holder pays an amount each time, up to a maximum which is the Cap rate.

optional underlying transaction	A transaction which is defined in an options contract and which may or may not take place, at the discretion of the holder of the option. If it does take place, this will be a transaction for the purchase or sale of the deliverable underlying as defined in the option contract, or some cash equivalent thereof. Further notes: This is not any different from any other kind of derivatives transaction. The Transaction is still defined as the purchase and sale of the underlying even if it is cash settled. It is defined as the swap of the fixed price for the current market price. Would define a reference price for the current market price if it's not a physical settlement. Would for example define the use of a calculation agent. Scenarios: 1. Agree to cash settle even though the underlying is a deliverable 2. Agree to settle cash because it's difficult to get hold of the underlying 3. The underlying is by its nature not deliverable 4. Fx where the deliverable is a currency to cash delivery is synonymous with delivery of the underlying asset, so the underlying observable and the underlying deliverable are the same actual thing. How this is modeled: Cash \"Settlement\" (means cash delivery) is where you take cash instad of delivery of the underlying deliverable. Whatever is going to be delivered there is going to be a reverse transaction at the going market rate. That also covers the use of an index or basket as the underlying. Examples of this: IR Swap - not an Option.	rel:definition	1

variance leg terms	A return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. Variance of a single price (over time - how is this modeled? Is this the duration of the contract or some defined period or poeriods of time). The variance gets its time basis from the negotiated period in the contract, e.g. Variance over 3 months. Check: Is this always the duration of the contract or can it be for example a set of time scales (say monthly) ove the life of say a 6 month contract, and take an average?? This is logically possible but we don't know if this is what this is. FpML: A type describing return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. More notes 17 Mar Varianc v covariance Variance is a surrogate for option. Talks about random fluctuation in prices If you look at options theory (black scholes) then the price of an option is 1rily dependent in variation in the price. The more variable the more expensive ot maintain a portfolio that is indifferent to the next move in price. So this Variance Swap allows you to extract that option price (i.e. the variance as above) into the variability of the underlying price. So then the asset being traded is in fact the asset that the price references. context: This is all about controlling the price of an asset (from the point of view of the portfolio holder). similarly with the variance on an index you are picking up on the generic market stability. Recall that an index is controlling an underlying portfolio, but with the index you talk directly about the price (in an index swap), this gives you control of a portfolio that is represented by that index. Basket Swap is this - difference is agreed basket (Index, which has a publisher) versus Basket where the \"index\" (we don't call it that here) is a basket of securities.	rel:definition	1

novated option contract	An Option Contract after the stage where a Derivatives Exchange has novated this contract and become the principal to it, for purposes of clearing and settlement.

So you write a contract and give it to the ringleader, who then books it. So the party you dealt with deals with the exahcnge, and you deal with the exchange. THen there are two contracts for one deal. So the answer here is that there are two novated contracts for one Options deal. Difference: If not open outcry? In OO the deal is done and given to the ringleader, who represents the Cleaing house. When it's not open outcry, the clearing house gets the deal, books the deal, and margins it. So you don't know as much about the deal and process. This eliminiates stickiness of a market that has credit.

These same safeguards allow the corporation to remove the assets from its balance sheet. The corporation generally continues to service the assets - collecting interest and principal payments, pursuing delinquencies, etc. It is paid out of asset cash flows for providing these ongoing services.	rel:definition	1

cdo note	Collateralized Debt Obligation. This is a type of asset-backed security and is constructed from a portfolio of fixed income assets including corporate loans and mortgage backed securities. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) issues notes to investors in order to raise funds that are invested in a portfolio of those fixed income assets, held by the SPV as collateral for the notes. Further notes: Collateralized Debt Obligation, for example, ABS CDO which consists of a portfolio of different ABS bonds, and the payments to the holders of these trust certificates are derived from the cash flows of the ABS bonds. This CDO instrument is part of a CDO issue, consisting of individual CDO instruments of a given seniority. Often referred to as tranches and slices (Investopedia). Investopedia: Similar in structure to a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO), CDOs are unique in that they represent different types of debt and credit risk. In the case of CDOs, these different types of debt are often referred to as 'tranches' or 'slices'. Each slice has a different maturity and risk associated with it. The higher the risk, the more the CDO pays. Further details: Collateralized Debt obligations are securitized interests in pools of - generally non-mortgage - assets. Assets - called collateral - usually comprise loans or debt instruments. A CDO may be called a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO) if it holds only loans or bonds, respectively. Investors bear the credit risk of the collateral. Multiple tranches of securities are issued by the CDO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics.	rel:definition	1

A security exhibits positive convexity when its price rises more for a downward move in its yield than its price declines for an equal upward move in its yield. Further notes: A measure of the change in price for a given change in Modified Duration. This always (necessarily) refers to Modified Duration. This is used as another risk measurement. Numerator is always (a) duration - either MacCaulays or Modified. Always rate of change of (one of the) Duration against some other parameter. The other paramater can be characterised as a Yield (it may be the Price, but that has a relationship to the Yield in any case). REVIEW: Inconsistency in the above - is it always necessarily Modified Duration that is referred to, or \"any\" Duration measure (Macaulays and.or Modified)? notes 9 Dec A measure of the sensitivity of the price with reference to interest rates. This is normally determined with reference to maturity, but since there are different maturity dates, this figure gives an estimate of the equitvalent if you had a homogenous portfolio, i.e. this is an estimate based on a pure equivalent, homogenous portfolio. Convexity of instrument versus portfolio. Sees instrument in terms of the set of cashflows. The term Convexity can be applied either to a bond or to a portfolio. More notes: When you get Convexit in MD, it will tell you what Duration it is refrfering to, along with Redemption Date (logically). Also if there is Option Adjusted Yield, there is a third set of analytics. What are they? i.e. OA Convexity, Duration Yield and the rest. Conclusions: Agreed to revisit this in OTC.	rel:definition	1

lender right	Rights on the lender to protect them against loss. furthe rNtoes: Logically, considering the two parties, they both have protecxtion mechanisms. so while the lender has protecxtion mechanisms through mortgage insurance, and the consumer has protextion mechanisms such as good faith estimates. also the agencies (see Consumer Protection Agency), an instance of which is the CFPB in the US (just set up). Lender rights are: - expressed in the Contract Consumer protection develops becaues the contract is written by the potential Lender. So the rights are introcued to rectify the imbalance between the two parties. Same goes for insurance. consumer protection laws (governe dby the relevant consumer protection agency. So the lender protexts itself as it writes th contract AND does the things it needs to do to protext itself, but on the approval process, and with later instruments such as insurance. Interestingly., it is the Borrower who pays for this by paying for credit reports etc. So the borrower protects itself by other mechanisms. Caveat emptor - displaced by regulation (the buyer is protected by regulation). Uberimae Fidae - in the utmost good faith. Mortgage Insurance is an additional means of mitigating the risk, that the lended may have., so if the information assessed is not accurate, or if the borrower's situation changes for the worse. then the risk rating may go down. So the Mortgage Insurance is a further strategy which mitigates any shortfall in the Lender Righrs that you may have - ie someone guarantees. In the US you can also avoid that by having paid a deposit. PIMI: Principal, Interst and Morgage Insurance. So the Borrower pays towards the MI, esxcept if they have paid a given amount as deposit. there are 2 types of MI: 1. protects the lender in the event of borrower degault 2. Insurance for \"Incapacity to pay the mortage\" (these can be bought off the shelf - can combine health, unemployment etc.). - this is the Borrower mitigating their own risk. Prevents foreclosure. Similar to general sickness etc. Where the lender charges for MI, the cost is passed onto the Borrower. e.g. if there is a % valuation (e.g. 70% in Aus, 80% in US for example) then no insurance is required.	rel:definition	1

dutch auction	"The party to which the offer is made need not be the holder. Details: Question on \""Who is the actor?\"" Dutch auction would have multiple parties? What is the scenario? Usually happens when a company is about to go into administration. Looking at the scneario descried in the SWIFT definition - not clear if this is the only such scenario. Possibly the issuer has to notif ythe shareholders that the offer is being made. The offer is made by the third party but the notice is sent by the issuer (via their agent) and via the registrar who holds the details of who holds all the shares. Example: Lloyds banking group - most shares would be owned by the market, and a small percentage might be held by private investors. So in this scenario everyone has to be given the opportunity to sell at the given price. so the CAE message is still issued by the Issuer. SWIFT detailed names (synonym?) \""Dutch Auction, Bid Tender\""	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	1
dutch auction	""Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is an action by a party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. UPDATE THIS DEFINITION: Similar to a tender offer, a Dutch auction is the result of an action by a third party wishing to acquire a particular security. Current holders of the targeted security are invited (and given a message by the issuer) to make an offer in which they would be willling to sell their holdings. OR It might also represent a separate scenario where third parties do this, as per the original SWIFT defition. You can only go to the Registrar which would the other scenario impossible. Agents and Registrars: The issue issuer os the company which issued the shares (as modeled); Most companies don't interact directly with the market to find out who they need to disseminate the info to. They can, but more likely the employ \""Issuers Agent\"". That provides one point of contact from the organization. That agent handles all coms with the Registrars, and to the news wires etc., to disseminate the corporate action. Context: CAE only, or in the context of the Issue? When you issue the security you nominate an Agent, in the prospectus, there is specified an Issuing Agent. This is the one that does these things. Usually a merchant bank etc. in the old days. This is who will have directly facilitated that direct market engagement. Next question: This is part of going public, so these agents are appointed as part of going public."	rel:definition	1

Once you get into the default scenario we are talking about a proces that is going to fall into place over a period of time. The bank works out what to do with the default scenario, e.g. whether it restructures, forecloses, seeks restitution from the security (collateral). It does nto help us to understand the structure of the loan, rather tha consequences of the loan. If we were to further explore the default detail we would bring in other SMEs. And we would have to model a process flow. 1.1 impact on the pool of an MBS Loan Default Proceeding (special ase of legal thing) is an aspect of Default Management / Administratoin. there is also the State of the Loan.

future instrument	Agreement to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity, a currency or a financial instrument at a particular price on a stipulated future date. A futures contract obligates the buyer to purchase the underlying commodity, currency or financial instrument and the seller to sell it unless the contract is sold to another before settlement date which may happen if a trader waits to take a profit or cut a loss. Further notes: This contrasts with options trading in which the option buyer may choose whether or not to exercise the option by the exercise date. Unlike options, futures convey an obligation to buy. The risk to the holder is unlimited, and because the payoff pattern is symmetrical, the risk to the seller is unlimited as well. Dollars lost and gained by each party on a futures contract are equal and opposite. In other words, futures trading is a zero-sum game. Futures contracts are forward contracts, meaning they represent a pledge to make a certain transaction at a future date. The exchange of assets occurs on the date specified in the contract. Futures are distinguished from generic forward contracts in that they contain standardized terms, trade on a formal exchange, are regulated by overseeing agencies, and are guaranteed by clearinghouses. Also, in order to insure that payment will occur, futures have a margin requirement that must be settled daily. Finally, by making an offsetting trade, taking delivery of goods, or arranging for an exchange of goods, futures contracts can be closed. Hedgers often trade futures for the purpose of keeping price risk in check. Definition origin: Barrons, adapted by EDMC SMER.	rel:definition	1

draft	A draft is a legally binding order by one party (the drawer) to a second party (the drawee) to make payment to a third party (the payee).

For example, someone might write himself a check as a simple means of transferring funds from one bank account to another. In this case, the drawer and payee are the same person. When a draft guarantees payment for goods in international trade, it is called a bill of exchange. A draft can require immediate payment by the second party to the third upon presentation of the draft. This is called a sight draft. Checks are sight drafts. In trade, drafts often are for deferred payment. An importer might write a draft promising payment to an exporter for delivery of goods with payment to occur 60 days after the goods are delivered. Such drafts are called time drafts. They are said to mature on the payment date. In this example, the importer is both the drawer and the drawee. Definition source: riskglossary.com	rel:definition	1

construction loan credit facility tranche	A loan taken out for construction purposes. Further notes: These are a temporary loan. when the construction is finished then that loan is transformed to another loan, which would be a permanent loan. Information to follow on what the new permanent loan would be. Terms are adjusted in the new loan, since in construction loans the rates are significantly higher. This is an incentive to complete the construction works. Notes from PoC reviews, discussing Maximum Balance concept: In a Construction Loan you agree a maximum amount that you could draw. As you progress with the construction you continue to draw more and more. So you start with the minimum. Example: for purpose of construction of a house you could need to borrow up to 500K and the bank establishes the milestones at which certain amounts are made availalbe and can be drawn. For instance prior to start you might draw 10%, (50K); the next 50K would be available to draw only once the foundations are laid. And so on. Milestones may include \"Frame standing\" (for American-style frame based houses). Each stage requires inspection on behalf of the bank. So you are starting with no more than 10% (in this example) of what is allowable, and could arrive to the full 500K by the end of ths construction but it is not mandated that you arrive to that. What differentiates a Construction Loan is that there si a max amount specified and there are Milestones specified in which the amounts for each milestone can be advanced.	rel:definition	1

cap determination	The Strike rate is to be subtracted from the Observable rate on the reset date, to determine the settlement amount. This is incorrect.

You as the seller of the option will pay me thedifference bwteen the capped rate and the market reate. If the market rate is lower than the capped rate no one pays anything because I will not exercise my right to that capped rate. So no money changes hands at settlement. Then: capped Loan: What I would be paying would be interest at the market rate if the market rate is lower, but if the market rate is higher then I would pay interest at the capped rate. This is the difference between a cap as a loan or as a cash settled thing. These represent different kinds of contract: Non loan one: Cap talks of settlement being difference between the market rate and the strike rate. This is cash settled. Name: \"Cap\" Loan one: Cap talks about a maximum interest rate payable by the holder, so the holder pays an amount each time, up to a maximum which is the Cap rate.

optional underlying transaction	A transaction which is defined in an options contract and which may or may not take place, at the discretion of the holder of the option. If it does take place, this will be a transaction for the purchase or sale of the deliverable underlying as defined in the option contract, or some cash equivalent thereof. Further notes: This is not any different from any other kind of derivatives transaction. The Transaction is still defined as the purchase and sale of the underlying even if it is cash settled. It is defined as the swap of the fixed price for the current market price. Would define a reference price for the current market price if it's not a physical settlement. Would for example define the use of a calculation agent. Scenarios: 1. Agree to cash settle even though the underlying is a deliverable 2. Agree to settle cash because it's difficult to get hold of the underlying 3. The underlying is by its nature not deliverable 4. Fx where the deliverable is a currency to cash delivery is synonymous with delivery of the underlying asset, so the underlying observable and the underlying deliverable are the same actual thing. How this is modeled: Cash \"Settlement\" (means cash delivery) is where you take cash instad of delivery of the underlying deliverable. Whatever is going to be delivered there is going to be a reverse transaction at the going market rate. That also covers the use of an index or basket as the underlying. Examples of this: IR Swap - not an Option.	rel:definition	1

variance leg terms	A return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. Variance of a single price (over time - how is this modeled? Is this the duration of the contract or some defined period or poeriods of time). The variance gets its time basis from the negotiated period in the contract, e.g. Variance over 3 months. Check: Is this always the duration of the contract or can it be for example a set of time scales (say monthly) ove the life of say a 6 month contract, and take an average?? This is logically possible but we don't know if this is what this is. FpML: A type describing return which is driven by a Variance Calculation. More notes 17 Mar Varianc v covariance Variance is a surrogate for option. Talks about random fluctuation in prices If you look at options theory (black scholes) then the price of an option is 1rily dependent in variation in the price. The more variable the more expensive ot maintain a portfolio that is indifferent to the next move in price. So this Variance Swap allows you to extract that option price (i.e. the variance as above) into the variability of the underlying price. So then the asset being traded is in fact the asset that the price references. context: This is all about controlling the price of an asset (from the point of view of the portfolio holder). similarly with the variance on an index you are picking up on the generic market stability. Recall that an index is controlling an underlying portfolio, but with the index you talk directly about the price (in an index swap), this gives you control of a portfolio that is represented by that index. Basket Swap is this - difference is agreed basket (Index, which has a publisher) versus Basket where the \"index\" (we don't call it that here) is a basket of securities.	rel:definition	1

novated option contract	An Option Contract after the stage where a Derivatives Exchange has novated this contract and become the principal to it, for purposes of clearing and settlement.

So you write a contract and give it to the ringleader, who then books it. So the party you dealt with deals with the exahcnge, and you deal with the exchange. THen there are two contracts for one deal. So the answer here is that there are two novated contracts for one Options deal. Difference: If not open outcry? In OO the deal is done and given to the ringleader, who represents the Cleaing house. When it's not open outcry, the clearing house gets the deal, books the deal, and margins it. So you don't know as much about the deal and process. This eliminiates stickiness of a market that has credit.

cdo note	Collateralized Debt Obligation. This is a type of asset-backed security and is constructed from a portfolio of fixed income assets including corporate loans and mortgage backed securities. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) issues notes to investors in order to raise funds that are invested in a portfolio of those fixed income assets, held by the SPV as collateral for the notes. Further notes: Collateralized Debt Obligation, for example, ABS CDO which consists of a portfolio of different ABS bonds, and the payments to the holders of these trust certificates are derived from the cash flows of the ABS bonds. This CDO instrument is part of a CDO issue, consisting of individual CDO instruments of a given seniority. Often referred to as tranches and slices (Investopedia). Investopedia: Similar in structure to a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO), CDOs are unique in that they represent different types of debt and credit risk. In the case of CDOs, these different types of debt are often referred to as 'tranches' or 'slices'. Each slice has a different maturity and risk associated with it. The higher the risk, the more the CDO pays. Further details: Collateralized Debt obligations are securitized interests in pools of - generally non-mortgage - assets. Assets - called collateral - usually comprise loans or debt instruments. A CDO may be called a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) or collateralized bond obligation (CBO) if it holds only loans or bonds, respectively. Investors bear the credit risk of the collateral. Multiple tranches of securities are issued by the CDO, offering investors various maturity and credit risk characteristics.	rel:definition	1
