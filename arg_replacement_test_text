The functions of the Commercial Register with respect to the information submitted are publication, examination, control and safekeeping. 
The content may be taken as accurate by any party referring to the register.
The entries to the Commercial Register are made by a judge or an authorised employee (Rechtspfleger, lit. "law caretaker"). 
As of 2007 all submissions to the Register have to me made electronically.
Anybody may request an extract from the Commercial Register about a specific company, the so-called Ausdruck (printout), which was formerly known as Handelsregisterauszug or HR-Auszug. 
A simple extract is usually priced at €10.00, a notarized one about €20.00 (as of May 2016). 
Information about registered companies can also be downloaded online (Handelsregister online, the common register portal of the German federal states), but may require prior registration. 
It is possible to retrieve PDF printouts (then called Abdruck) with different level of information, e.g. AD - Aktueller Abdruck contains only the most current information whereas CD - Chronologischer Abdruck comprises current and historical data. 
A fee of €4.50 for each printout will be charged (as of May 2016).
