A bank earns money by reinvesting these funds in longer-term assets."

This rule appears in FpML both in the BusinessDayConventionEnum and the RollConventionEnum (for date roll rules and for scheduled event dates respectively). From FpML definition for BusinessDayConventionEnum: \"... Note that FRN is included here as a type of business day convention although it does not strictly fall within ISDA's definition of a Business Day Convention and does not conform to the simple definition given above.\" Note that this FRN rule is also included in the FpML enumeration for \"RollConventionEnum\". This is the enumeration of possible Calculation Period End Dates and uses the word \"Roll\" in a completely different sense (the date that the application of some calculation to some amount is rolled over from one rate to the next). Full definition from ISDA 2000 Section 4.11: Section 4.11. FRN Convention; Eurodollar Convention. \"FRN Convention\" or \"Eurodollar Convention\" means, in respect of either Payment Dates or Period End Dates for a Swap Transaction and a party, that the Payment Dates or Period End Dates of that party will be each day during the Term of the Swap Transaction that numerically corresponds to the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party in the calendar month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date occurred (or, in the case of the first applicable Payment Date or the Period End Date, the day that numerically corresponds to the Effective Date in the calendar month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the Effective Date occurred), except that (a) if there is not any such numerically corresponding day in the calendar month in which a Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party should occur, then the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the last day that is a Business Day in that month, (b) if a Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of the party would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, then the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the first following day that is a Business Day unless that day falls in the next calendar month, in which case the Payment Date or Period End Date will be the first preceding day that is a Business Day and (c) if the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date, as the case may be, of that party occurred on the last day in a calendar month that was a Business Day, then all subsequent applicable Payment Dates or Period End Dates, as the case may be, of that party prior to the Termination Date will be the last day that is a Business Day in the month that is the specified number of months after the month in which the preceding applicable Payment Date or Period End Date occurred."

Review session notes: 10 Mar Helpful to split these according to the assets that are swapped. So for instance there are equity swaps, commodity swaps where you swap different assets. These are not mutually exclusive to labels about Fund Leg, and so on, that are different ways that people trading in those assets distinguish between those legs. For example in IR, we talk Fixed, Floating. capital Index Swap, where the return on oen leg is indexed to an inflation index but it's still an IR swap where the payment relates to an inflation index. So keeping the 2 legs in some sort of notion balance - example index annuity swap, capital index swap and so on. These terms refer to the behavior of the underlying swap rather than an arbitrary classification of what leg is what. Different structures of swap is less relevant. 17 March: Remember: the contract does not necessarily have 2 legs, but it usually would. The structure is in the transactions, i.e., the commitments embodied in the terms for the two sides of those transactions, the legs which are simply the embodiment of those commitments, and so on. Then the details structure is in the leg definitions. Note also that different kinds of leg can have various structures regardless of how or why they are used in a contract."

The board has the ultimate decision-making authority and, in general, is empowered to (1) set the company's policy, objectives, and overall direction, (2) adopt bylaws, (3) name members of the advisory, executive, finance, and other committees, (4) hire, monitor, evaluate, and fire the managing director and senior executives, (5) determine and pay the dividend, and (6) issue additional shares. Though all its members might not be engaged in the company's day-to-day operations, the entire board is held liable (under the doctrine of collective responsibility) for the consequences of the firm's policies, actions, and failures to act. Members of the board usually include senior-most executives (called inside directors or executive directors) as well as experts or respected persons chosen from the wider community (called outside directors or non-executive directors)."

If the instrument has no bilateral or multilateral obligations, the investor can easily transfer it to another investor without asking the borrower (except the terms prohibit this explicitly). This is simplified with securitised instruments, where the debt is already split into handy denominations which trade easily (e.g. in round thousands or millions as with bonds, commercial paper, etc.). But in principle it works also with interbank loans and similar instruments. FIBIM Definition: Financial instruments evidencing moneys owed by the issuer to the holder on terms as specified."

<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/SEC/vocabulary#SecuritiesExchange>	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	"A securities exchange is a corporation or mutual organization that provides securities trading services, where securities may be bought and sold by third parties. As a facility, a securities exchange is also a place of trade associated with a particular site, i.e., stock exchange, regulated market such as an Electronic Trading Platform (ECN), or unregulated market, such as an Automated Trading System (ATS) (MIC - ISO 10383). Stock exchanges also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of securities as well as other financial instruments and capital events including the payment of income and dividends.\n\nThe securities traded on a stock exchange include: shares issued by companies, unit trusts, derivatives, pooled investment products and bonds. To be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, it has to be listed there. Usually there is a central location at least for recordkeeping, but trade is less and less linked to such a physical place, as modern markets are electronic networks, which gives them advantages of speed and cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is by members only."

A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items - finding a single 'figure of merit' for these items - when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. For example, the geometric mean can give a meaningful 'average' to compare two companies which are each rated at 0 to 5 for their environmental sustainability, and are rated at 0 to 100 for their financial viability. If an arithmetic mean were used instead of a geometric mean, the financial viability is given more weight because its numeric range is larger - so a small percentage change in the financial rating (e.g. going from 80 to 90) makes a much larger difference in the arithmetic mean than a large percentage change in environmental sustainability (e.g. going from 2 to 5)."

<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/FND/vocabulary#NationalIdentificationNumber>	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	"A national identification number, national identity number, or national insurance number is used by the governments of many countries as a means of tracking their citizens, permanent residents, and temporary residents for the purposes of work, taxation, government benefits, health care, and other governmentally-related functions. The number will appear on an identity document issued by a country.\n\nThe ways in which such a system is implemented are dependent on the country, but in most cases, a citizen is issued an identification number at birth or when they reach a legal age (typically the age of 18). Non-citizens may be issued such numbers when they enter the country, or when granted a temporary or permanent residence permit.\n\nMany countries issued such numbers ostensibly for a singular purpose, but over time, they become a de facto national identification number. For example, the United States originally developed its Social Security number system as a means of disbursing Social Security benefits. However, due to function creep, the number has become utilized for other purposes to the point where it is almost essential to have one to, among other things, open a bank account, obtain a credit card, or drive a car."

An individual establishment is generally classified by having one NAICS code associated with it for statistical purposes, whereas an enterprise may be classified by multiple NAICS codes. The statistical structure is defined based on the operating structure and the accounting data produced by that entity.  A given location may only need to publish revenues, whereas an operating unit (establishment) has employment statistics, etc.  An establishment is defined as a producing unit at a single geographical location at which or from which economic activity is conducted and for which, at a minimum, employment data are available.  In the case of a home-based business, the actual physical location would be specified as two distinct institutional units - as a household from a personal living and consumer perspective and as an establishment / operating unit due to the statistics required of the business."

Hence percentages as contractual terms. For instance an option to exercise which would give another 5 percent control. So there is percentage control with or without share ownership. Example: In a partnership this might be in the Partnership Agreement, which would identify beneficial ownership and control as potentially 2 distinct things. Contract can say anything. Implications: This means that there are percentages of de jure control based in contract, similar to those based in constitutional instruments (shares, General Partner equity). The concepts of Parent, Siinificant Part Owner etc. can then potentially be defined int erms of the percentages of all applicable instruments by which control may be formally defined."

GDP is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. Conceptually, this measure can be arrived at by three separate means: as the sum of goods and services sold to final users, as the sum of income payments and other costs incurred in the production of goods and services, and as the sum of the value added at each stage of production. Although these three ways of measuring GDP are conceptually the same, their calculation may not result in identical estimates of GDP because of differences in data sources, timing, and estimation techniques."

The house's prime responsibility is to provide efficiency and stability to the financial markets that they operate in.\n\nThere are two main processes that are carried out by CCPs: clearing and settlement of market transactions. Clearing relates to identifying the obligations of both parties on either side of a transaction. Settlement occurs when the final transfer of securities and funds occur.\n\nCCPs benefit both parties in a transaction because they bear most of the credit risk. If two individuals deal with one another, the buyer bears the credit risk of the seller, and vice versa. When a CCP is used the credit risk that is held against both buyer and seller is coming from the CCP, which in all likelihood is much less than in the previous situation."

The body of precedent is called common law and it binds future decisions. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (this principle is known as stare decisis). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a matter of first impression), judges have the authority and duty to make law by creating precedent. Thereafter, the new decision becomes precedent, and will bind future courts."

But a given duration (i.e., the duration of something) is an instance of ‘duration’ and thus a ‘particular quantity,’ not an instance of ‘quantity kind’. For example, a ‘year’ is not an instance of quantity kind; it is an instance of quantity, but not a category of quantity."

The most common example is interest rates, where differences in interest rates of less than 1% per year are usually meaningful to talk about.

<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/DER/vocabulary#Underlier>	<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#editorialNote>	"The underlier breaks down into two separate meanings: The item which determines the value of the contract (the observable), and the item that is deliverable upon expiry or exercise of the contract (if there is one). These are usually the same item but in some cases such as index derivatives the exercise takes a different form. Action: Add 'Observable' as a distinct term. Then use Deliverable. Is Underlier the union? In a Call Option the Underlier is the Deliverable and is referred to as the Underlier. With an Fx Call Option, the deliverable is the cash value which you are exchanging for the amount in another currency (so this is no difference as cash is instrument). Then take IR Swap where 3mo LIBOR Rate is the Observable, but the delivery is Cash. Then one would refer to the LIBOR as the Observable. Delivers an amount based on the observable, and the delivered cash is the Deliverable. So what we refer to as Underlier may be the Observable or the Deliverable e.g. Call option on IBM the deliverable is the IBM Stock whereas a Swap leg depending on LIBOR, the Deliverable is Cash but the 'Underlier' is the Observable. Would be nore accurate not to refer to the Observable not as an Underlier. Therefore there would be nothing referred to as the 'Underlier' as such. However, all derivatives have Underlier. Take an IR Cap, would not not refer to it as having an Underlier - the notion of Underlier becomes fuzzier when you get to higher order derivatives. LIBOR on a list of dates is an 'Observable' but is several amounts."

<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/SEC/vocabulary#ParametricSchedule>	<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#editorialNote>	"This is a schedule for one of the events that occur in a periodic schedule of interest accruals, interest payments, and (for floating rate swapstreams), changes to the interest rate. These may be specified individually but more commonly the Calculation event is the one scheduled according to this kind of parametric schedule, with the other dates specified as an offset to these. Here we have allowed for each of the related dates to be independently parametrically scheduled. The notional amount step schedule is a separate kind of schedule, with similar terms but without a period length. For calculation schedules (and possibly payments, resets), there is a different end date to the end /start of the period, since events may be specified as being on specific dates - this is where the Roll Convention comes in. This has the same basic concepts as the generic schedule shown as the parent to this. However, where the upper model has Date with various applicable sub types (known i.e. calendar, specified or determined). For example, an ISDA FpML schedule has a Specified Date (via a convention), and then has a date roll rule which is specified for the whole schedule and applies to each of the dates returned by the parametric specification of the schedule. It has: A schedule beginning and end; A set of regular repeating periods: the scheduled event takes place once per period; Optionally one or two stubs (one start and one end); these may be longer than the repeating period, or shorter. The precise parameters used are: Start of the overall Schedule period: Effective Date End of the overall Schedule period: Termination Date Start of first regular period: not specified (assume Effective Date?) Length of each regular period: Frequency (actually a duration) There are generally three ways in which the regular periods of a parametric schedule may be expressed: first plus last first plus period length last plus period length event date plus period length. In FpML, Roll events (the date that something rolls over from the value used in one period to the value used in the next) is defined in a Roll Convention, which may be a day of the month, a day of the week, or some published set of dates, typically the ISDA quarterly dates for these events. This is therefore the date within the regular period (before adjustments) when the event occurs. This is in addition so a date for the start or end of such a period. In general this applies to the Calculation Schedule (i.e. the event is the calculation event) with other dates specified relative to this, however in principle the other related events (payment and reset or refix) are specified relative to this. It is not immediately clear what specification of a date replaces the Roll event convention element when this happens."

It normally states the (1) purpose for which the trust was established and fulfillment of which will terminate the trust, (2) details of the assets placed in the trust, (3) powers and limitations of the trustees, their reporting requirements, and other associated provisions, and (4) may also specify the trustees' compensation, if any. A trust agreement involving real estate requires its exact description and the trustor's express, written consent to create the trust to be valid. A will admitted to probate may also act like a trust agreement."

<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/FND/vocabulary#AutonomousAgent>	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	"Agents, then, can be software agents, hardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents, and so on.  While software developers naturally think of IT systems as being constructed of only software agents, a combination of agent mechanisms might in fact be used from shop-floor manufacturing to warfare systems.  The definition incorporated herein must be sufficiently general to account for these and other uses, such as for describing people and organizations who participate in broader processes and systems, for FIBO, other OMG standards and usage, and in general.\n\nWhether or not you restrict your view of agents to the software variety, most agree that agents deployed for IT systems are not useful without the following three important properties:\n\n(1) Autonomous - an agent is capable of acting without direct external intervention.  Agents have some degree of control over their internal state and can act based on their own experiences. They can also possess their own set of internal responsibilities and processing that enable them to act without any external choreography.  When an agent acts on behalf of (or as a proxy for) some person or thing, its autonomy is expected to embody the goals and policies of the entity that it represents.\n\n(2) Interactive - an agent communicates with the environment and other agents. Agents are interactive entities because they are capable of exchanging rich forms of messages with other entities in their environment.  These messages can support requests for services and other kinds of resources, as well as event detection and notification.  They can be synchronous or asynchronous in nature.  The interaction can also be conversational in nature, such as negotiating contracts, marketplace-style bidding, or simply making a query.\n\n(3) Adaptive - an agent is capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment. Agents can react to messages and events and then respond appropriately.  Agents can be designed to make difficult decisions and even modify their behavior based on their experiences.  They can learn and evolve."

If the offeree acts on the offeror's promise, the offeror is legally obligated to fulfill the contract, but an offeree cannot be forced to act (or not act), because no return promise has been made to the offeror. After an offeree has performed, only one enforceable promise exists, that of the offeror.\n\nA unilateral contract differs from a Bilateral Contract, in which the parties exchange mutual promises. Bilateral contracts are commonly used in business transactions; a sale of goods is a type of bilateral contract."

Debt that is defined by a convertible bond are redeemed by conversion into an equity security issued by the same company. More notes from the EDMC SME Review: Distinction between call and amortizing is whether you pay off everybody at the same time or via a lottery. SF can be either. either amortize the payment of a SF or pay it off by a lottery. The terms of the instrument determine that. Mandatory - all in the schedule. Mandatory to the bond issuer. Issuer has to pay off a certain amount at a certain time - this is in the Schedule. Callable - nothing mandatory."

Each exchange has a standard for these specific terms, for contracts that are traded on that exchange. Expiry: there is a standard date that the exchange will have, for example in the US it is the Saturday following the third Friday of every month. So there is a set expiration date for all exchange traded optons Strike: there are set increments for strike for exchange traded options. Contract sizes are also stipulated, for example in the US these are standardized by the OPRA Convention (Options Pricing Reporting Authority). Ajay: Exchange traded is tri party contract with central counterparty for the setelemtn fo the options. Market place (usually electronic), hence standard to process data. Not necessarily a legal difference? So for instance you would not be able to trade different lot sizes. So they enter in the contract which is guaranteed by the exchange. Members of the exchange trade with each other. The Exchange then being a third party. OTC: Bilateral Exchange traded: Still bilateral, using standardized terms. Lookalikes: for examples, where there are usually ones with monthly margin calls (exchange traded), there are 'lookalike' ones which look like an ET but are traded outside the market. Common in commodities market. What else can be standardised? What must be standardidsed?

It has shareholders with limited liability and its shares may not be offered to the general public, unlike those of public limited companies. Additional notes from Wikipedia: Limited by shares means that the company has shareholders, and that the liability of the shareholders to creditors of the company is limited to the capital originally invested, i.e. the nominal value of the shares and any premium paid in return for the issue of the shares by the company. A shareholders personal assets are thereby protected in the event of the companys insolvency, but money invested in the company will be lost. A limited company may be private or public. A private limited companys disclosure requirements are lighter, but for this reason its shares may not be offered to the general public (and therefore cannot be traded on a public stock exchange). This is the major distinguishing feature between a private limited company and a public limited company. Most companies, particularly small companies, are private. Private companies limited by shares are required to have the suffix Limited (often written Ltd or Ltd.) or Incorporated (Inc.) as part of their name, though the latter cannot be used in the UK or the Republic of Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, Teoranta (Teo.) may be used instead, largely by Gaeltacht companies. Cyfyngedig (Cyf.) may be used by Welsh companies in a similar fashion."

In this form, the Laspeyres index can be written as the sum of base-period revenue shares of the items in the index times their corresponding price relatives. Statistical agency practice has introduced some approximations to the theoretical Laspeyres target due to a number of practical problems with producing the Laspeyres index exactly. For these and other pragmatic reasons, some agencies use alternatives depending on circumstances. See the IMF publication cited for a full explanation of the most commonly used approaches and trade-offs made for determining PPI."

<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/IND/vocabulary#ProducerPriceIndex>	<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Utilities/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote>	"The standard methodology for a typical PPI is based on a Laspeyres price index with fixed quantities from an earlier base period. The construction of this index can be thought of in terms of selecting a basket of goods and services representative of base-period revenues, valuing this at base-period prices, and then repricing the same basket at current-period prices. The target PPI in this case is defined to be the ratio of these two revenues. Practicing statisticians use this methodology because it has at least three practical advantages. It is easily explained to the public, it can use often expensive and untimely weighting information from the date of the last (or an even earlier) survey or administrative source (rather than requiring sources of data for the current month), and it need not be revised if users accept the Laspeyres premise."

It sets out the rights and duties of directors and stockholders individually and in meetings. Certain statutory clauses (such as those dealing with allotment, transfer, and forfeiture of shares) must be included; the other clauses are chosen by the stockholders to make up the bylaws of the organization. A court, however, may declare a clause ultra vires if it is deemed unfair, unlawful, or unreasonable. A copy of the articles is lodged with the appropriate authority such as the registrar of companies. Articles are public documents and may be inspected by anyone (usually on payment of a fee) either at the premises of the organization or at the registrar's office. Lenders to the organization take special interest in its provisions that impose a ceiling on the borrowings beyond which the organization's management must get shareholders' approval before taking on more debt. The usual American term is articles of incorporation."
