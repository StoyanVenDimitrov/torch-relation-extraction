REGULATION (EU) 2016/867 OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
of 18 May 2016
on the collection of granular credit and credit risk data (ECB/2016/13)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 127(2) and (5) thereof,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in
particular Articles 5.1 and 34.1 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the collection of statistical
information by the European Central Bank (
1
), and in particular Articles 5(1) and 6(4) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Commission (
2
),
Whereas:
(1) Granular credit and credit risk data (hereinafter ‘credit data’) comprise detailed and individual information about
instruments giving rise to credit risk for deposit-taking corporations, financial corporations other than deposittaking
corporations or asset management vehicles, which are all engaged in lending on a significant scale. Such
detailed information is necessary for the performance of the tasks of the Eurosystem, the European System of
Central Banks (ESCB) and the European Systemic Risk Board, including monetary policy analysis and monetary
policy operations, risk management, financial stability surveillance and macroprudential policy and research.
These data will also be useful for banking supervision purposes in the context of the Single Supervisory
Mechanism (SSM).
(2) Article 5.1 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter
the ‘Statute of the ESCB’) specifies that the European Central Bank (ECB), assisted by the national central banks
(NCBs) of the ESCB, collects the necessary statistical information, either from the competent national authorities
or directly from economic agents, in order to carry out the tasks of the ESCB. Article 3 of Regulation (EC)
No 2533/98 requires the ECB to specify the actual reporting population within the limits of the reference
reporting population, and entitles it to fully or partly exempt specific classes of reporting agents from its
statistical reporting requirements.
(3) Credit data will substantially contribute to improving existing and developing new ESCB statistics, since it
provides important breakdowns and details not available from currently used data sources, such as information
on the structure and risk patterns of credit granted by the financial sector. For example, credit data will significantly
contribute to increasing the quality of statistics on: (a) loans according to the size of corporations; a key
feature for assessing and monitoring the provision of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises; (b) credit
lines broken down by counterparty sector; (c) loans to non-financial corporations broken down by economic
activity; (d) loans backed by real estate collateral; and (e) cross-border loans and related income as part of the
balance of payments statistics of Member States whose currency is the euro.
(4) The availability of credit data will improve the usability of the micro-level information currently collected on
securities issues and holdings statistics, and contribute to monitoring and fostering financial integration and
stability in the Union. Finally, credit data relating to branches that are resident outside the euro area, and whose
head offices are resident in a reporting Member State are important for the performance of ESCB tasks, in
particular for monetary policy analysis and financial stability tasks. In addition, the data can support macroprudential
supervision tasks such as financial stability analyses, risk assessments and stress testing. Article 8(1)(d)
and (4a) of Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 now specifically allow the use of statistical data collected under Article 5
of the Statute of the ESCB for supervisory purposes.

(

) Commission Opinion of 7 August 2015 on the draft Regulation of the European Central Bank concerning the collection of granular
credit and credit risk data (OJ C 261, 8.8.2015, p. 1). 
(5) A comprehensive set of harmonised analytical credit data should minimise the reporting burden by increasing the
stability of the reporting requirements over time. This is important because incorporating changes into the highly
automated data processing systems of reporting agents can be very costly. The harmonised set of credit data will
also provide greater detail, thus minimising the need for any additional requests addressed to reporting agents.
(6) Decision ECB/2014/6 (
1
) sets out the procedure for developing a long-term framework for the collection of
granular credit data based on harmonised ECB statistical reporting requirements. It aims to ensure the
establishment of: (a) national granular credit datasets operated by all Eurosystem NCBs in accordance with
common minimum standards; and (b) a common granular analytical credit database (hereinafter ‘AnaCredit’),
shared between the Eurosystem members and comprising input data from all Member States whose currency is
the euro.
(7) Recommendation ECB/2014/7 (
2
) encourages NCBs of Member States whose currency is not the euro, but who
are preparing to join the long-term framework, to apply the provisions of Decision ECB/2014/6. AnaCredit
should be open, on a voluntary basis, to Member States outside the euro area, in particular those participating in
the SSM, in order to broaden its geographical and data scope, and increase harmonisation across the Union.
(8) While the preparatory measures under Decision ECB/2014/6 aimed to define ‘a core group of harmonised
granular credit data sets that are to be provided to the ECB by the NCBs in the long term’, the outcome of the
merits and costs procedure showed very strong user requirements underlining the need not just for a ‘core group
of data sets’, but also for a comprehensive list of data attributes and measures that characterise the instruments
that generate credit risk for the reporting population. In addition, the resulting improved harmonisation should
increase the comparability of the data across countries and across institutions, thereby ensuring a higher data
quality for analysis.
(9) AnaCredit aims to provide, in combination with other statistical frameworks collecting granular information, an
analytical view of reporting agents' credit risk regardless of the financial instrument, type of exposure or
accounting classification. In this respect, the requirements laid down in this Regulation aim to ensure that
reporting agents report a common set of harmonised information to NCBs.
(10) AnaCredit should be established in stages, since the significant heterogeneity of the current credit data collection
across participating countries can only be gradually harmonised. This step-by-step approach also takes into
account the time needed for the reporting agents to comply with the various data requirements. Overall, the
scope and content of the data to be collected during the different stages should be defined as early as possible, in
order for all reporting agents to prepare for the use of a harmonised set of concepts and definitions. Hence, the
Governing Council will take its decision on each subsequent stage at least two years prior to its implementation.
With a view to minimising the costs and the workload for reporting agents, the provision of information on
housing loans on the basis of sampling techniques will be explored at a subsequent stage.
(11) While one of AnaCredit's key long-term objectives is to harmonise reporting requirements and implementation
practices, the heterogeneity of current data collection practices requires the preservation of NCB discretion in
certain areas, for example with regard to NCB decisions on derogations for small resident reporting agents. These
areas of NCB discretion should be reassessed at each future stage in order to determine whether further harmonisation
across participating countries can be achieved.
(12) In terms of scope, the first stage of reporting under AnaCredit should include credit granted by credit institutions
to legal entities. Deposit-taking corporations other than credit institutions, asset management vehicles and other
financial corporations, all engaged in lending, as well as foreign subsidiaries of these entities, may be included in
the actual reporting population in a subsequent stage. As regards instruments, the scope of granular reporting
may be extended to derivatives, other accounts receivable, off-balance-sheet items (such as financial guarantees)
and credit extended to persons other than legal persons, including to sole proprietors. No personal data, as

European System of Central Banks (OJ L 104, 8.4.2014, p. 72).
(

) Recommendation of the European Central Bank of 24 February 2014 on the organisation of preparatory measures for the collection of
granular credit data by the European System of Central Banks (ECB/2014/7) (OJ C 103, 8.4.2014, p. 1). 
defined by applicable data protection rules, should be collected in the first stage, including for multi-debtor
credits involving natural persons as debtors, or when natural persons are affiliated to instruments reported to
AnaCredit. Should the scope of reporting be extended to include such personal data in subsequent stages, the
protection of the rights of natural persons with regard to the collection and processing of their personal data
should be ensured. Moreover, subsequent stages may incorporate reporting requirements on a consolidated basis.
Any extension of the reporting population should take into account the NCBs' right to grant derogations to small
reporting agents, and should be adopted at least two years prior to its introduction to allow sufficient time for
implementation by reporting agents and NCBs.
(13) In preparing for future stages, an extension of the reporting population as well as an introduction of additional
reporting requirements should be based on an analysis by the Statistics Committee of the ESCB (hereinafter the
‘STC’), taking into account the users' needs, reporting agents' and NCBs' estimated costs, market developments
and the experience gained in preparing for the first stage.
(14) The reporting obligations on credit data should be defined taking into account the principle of proportionality, to
avoid imposing an undue reporting burden in particular on small reporting agents with limited total credit
exposure. For the same reason, NCBs should have the right to grant derogations to small reporting agents.
(15) With a view to ensuring efficient reporting and adequate interoperability with other existing or new reporting
frameworks, NCBs should be allowed to collect the information to be transmitted to the ECB as a part of a
broader national reporting framework and to extend the reporting of credit data beyond the scope outlined in
this Regulation, for their own statutory purposes, in line with relevant national law.
(16) To contribute to AnaCredit, NCBs should be allowed to use their own databases, data received from reporting
agents and any other sources, including relevant reference databases. NCBs should have the discretion to decide
whether they enter into cooperation arrangements with national statistical institutes (NSIs), or national competent
authorities (NCAs) for the supervision of reporting agents, or any other national authorities, as long as the data
provided meet the quality standards set out in this Regulation. Due to the different national arrangements
currently in place, and in order to minimise the reporting burden under this Regulation, effective and efficient
collaboration with NSIs, NCAs and other national authorities is encouraged.
(17) The framework for the collection of credit data should be set up with a view to ensuring interoperability with
central credit registers (CCRs) and other relevant credit data sets established by public sector entities, including
databases on securities statistics as well as the ESCB Register of Institutions and Affiliates Dataset.
(18) NCBs should be allowed to use the multi-purpose shared analytical granular credit data set to establish feedback
loops with reporting agents or to enrich existing feedback loops and other information services from CCRs to
reporting agents. These feedback loops will enhance the ESCB's contribution to the stability of the financial
system in line with its statutory mandate according to Article 127(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union. The feedback loops will provide reporting agents with a broader basis for their creditworthiness
assessments, in particular with regard to cross-border debtors, and enable the harmonisation of definitions and
data attributes throughout their lending practices. They will improve credit institutions' and other lenders' credit
risk management. In particular, they will support credit institutions in avoiding undue reliance on external credit
ratings for assessing creditworthiness. A feedback loop should follow best practices and ensure minimum data
quality standards. The subset of analytical credit data that may be shared between NCBs, for the purposes of the
feedback loops, should be defined taking into account the specific confidentiality level of the relevant data
attributes and the corresponding confidentiality protection requirements, as well as the time needed for
implementation. Further details on the scope and implementation of the feedback loops may be laid down in a
separate legal act and NCBs may enter into Memoranda of Understanding, based on the applicable legal
frameworks, regarding their respective cooperation in the feedback loops. While some NCBs that operate CCRs
L 144/46 EN Official Journal of the European Union 1.6.2016 
already share granular cross-border credit and credit risk data with each other on a bilateral basis (
1
), others may,
for legal reasons, require a certain time period to implement cross-border information sharing in order to pass
such data on to financial institutions reporting to them. The set-up and implementation of feedback loops should
take into account national legal provisions on the handling of confidential statistical information.
(19) For the purposes of this Regulation the standards for the protection and use of confidential statistical information
as laid down in Articles 8 to 8c of Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 should apply.
(20) Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 provides that the ECB has the power to impose sanctions on
reporting agents that fail to comply with statistical reporting requirements defined or imposed in ECB regulations
or decisions. This sanctioning power is independent of NCBs' right to sanction reporting agents who do not
comply with statistical or other reporting obligations that apply to them under the respective national legal
framework.
(21) It is necessary to establish a procedure for making technical amendments to the annexes to this Regulation in an
effective manner, provided they neither change the underlying conceptual framework nor affect the reporting
burden on reporting agents in Member States. This procedure needs to allow the views of the ESCB Statistics
Committee to be taken into account.
(22) Article 5 of the Statute of the ESCB, together with Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union, implies an
obligation to design and implement at national level all the measures that the Member States whose currency is
not the euro consider appropriate: (a) for carrying out the collection of the statistical information needed to fulfil
the ECB's statistical reporting requirements; and (b) for timely preparations in the field of statistics in order for
such Member States to become Member States whose currency is the euro.
(23) This Regulation should apply without prejudice to the collection of credit data under the legal framework of
the SSM,

of counterparties based on the scope of the information outlined in Annex III.
Article 10
Access to and use of credit data
1. The ECB and NCBs shall use credit data reported under this Regulation to the extent and for the purposes defined
in Regulation (EC) No 2533/98. Such data may be used, in particular, to establish and maintain a feedback loop in
accordance with Article 11.
2. This Regulation is without prejudice to existing or future uses of credit data that are permitted or required under
Union or national law, or Memoranda of Understanding, including cross-border exchanges.
Article 11
Feedback loop to reporting agents
1. NCBs have the right to provide credit data, including data collected by another NCB, to reporting agents by
establishing or enhancing feedback loops or other information services from CCRs to reporting agents. They may
provide a subset of the credit data collected under this Regulation, in line with best practices and to the extent allowed
by the applicable legal confidentiality regime. Reporting agents may use the data exclusively for managing credit risk and
improving the quality of credit information available to them with regard to existing or prospective instruments. They
shall not share the data with other parties, unless data sharing with service providers is strictly necessary for these
purposes, and the data are used only in relation to the reporting agent and the reporting agent ensures appropriate
confidentiality protection under a contractual agreement that excludes any other use of the data, and provides for the
anonymisation of the data wherever possible and deletion of the data as soon as the purpose for which they have been
shared has been achieved. Any further data transmission by the service provider, and any data sharing with commercial
providers of credit data is forbidden.
2. NCBs shall define the scope of data to be provided, the procedure for providing data access and any additional
restrictions on the use of such data, taking into account the national legal framework and any other constraints linked to
the confidential nature of the information.
3. This Article does not give reporting agents any right to a feedback loop, or to receiving specific information from
a feedback loop or other information services from CCRs to reporting agents.
1.6.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 144/51 
4. NCBs have the right to deny access on a temporary basis for a reporting agent to specific credit data from a
feedback loop where the reporting agent has not complied with its own statistical reporting obligations under this
Regulation, in particular with regard to data quality and accuracy, and in cases where a reporting agent has not
complied with its obligations set out in paragraph 1.
5. NCBs have the right to deny access to other NCBs to the granular credit data that they collect for the purposes of a
feedback loop. NCBs have the right to require reciprocity as regards provision of granular credit data with any NCB that
requests data from another NCB for the purposes of a feedback loop. Information on an institutional unit of a reporting
agent established in a reporting Member State may always be used for feedback loops by the relevant NCB of the
reporting agent, irrespective of where the institutional unit is resident.
Article 12
Access by legal entities
1. Legal entities or parts of legal entities about which credit data have been reported are entitled to access such data
at the relevant NCB. Furthermore, legal entities may request that reporting agents rectify incorrect data that relate to
them.
2. NCBs may deny a legal entity or parts of legal entities access to the credit data reported in relation to them, only
to the extent that:
(a) such access would violate the legitimate confidentiality interests of the reporting agent, for example with regard to
internal credit risk assessments, or of third parties, in particular, the legal entities about which credit data has been
reported; or
(b) the data has not been used to establish or enhance a feedback loop according to Article 11, and they are not
required to grant access to such data under any other Union or national law.
Article 13
Timeliness
1. Reporting agents shall report credit data as recorded on the following reporting reference dates:
(a) for monthly transmissions, on the last day of each month;
(b) for quarterly transmissions, on the last day of March, June, September and December.
2. NCBs shall decide when and how often they shall receive data from reporting agents in order to meet their
reporting deadlines to the ECB, and shall inform the reporting agents accordingly.
3. NCBs shall inform reporting agents about the reporting obligations at least 18 months before the first reporting
reference date for which such agents shall report data pursuant to this Regulation, without prejudice to any other
reporting requirements in accordance with national law or other reporting frameworks.
4. For observed agents that are resident in a reporting Member State, NCBs shall transmit monthly credit data to the
ECB by close of business on the 30th working day following the end of the month to which the data relate.
5. For observed agents that are resident in a reporting Member State, NCBs shall transmit quarterly credit data to the
ECB by close of business on the 15th working day following the remittance dates defined in Article 3(1)(b) of

6. For observed agents that are foreign branches not resident in a reporting Member State, NCBs shall transmit
monthly credit data to the ECB by close of business on the 35th working day following the end of the month to which
the data relate.
7. For observed agents that are foreign branches not resident in a reporting Member State, NCBs shall transmit
quarterly credit data to the ECB by close of business on the 20th working day following the remittance dates defined in
Article 3(1)(b) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014.
8. NCBs shall transmit to the ECB the counterparty reference data for all counterparties in accordance with Section 1
of Template 1 of Annex I together with the first transmission of credit data. When a change occurs, NCBs shall update
the data by no later than the transmission of credit data that is relevant for the first reporting reference date on or
before which the change came into effect. Unless NCBs inform reporting agents that they have obtained updated
counterparty reference data from other sources, reporting agents shall update such data by informing NCBs of any
changes at the time requested by the relevant NCB, but no later than the date on which credit data is reported to the
relevant NCB for the first reporting reference date following the date on which the change came into effect.
Article 14
Minimum common standards and national reporting arrangements
1. Reporting agents shall comply with the statistical reporting requirements to which they are subject, in accordance
with the minimum common standards for transmission, accuracy, accurate identification of counterparties and
compliance with concepts and revisions as specified in Annex V.
2. NCBs shall define and implement the reporting arrangements to be followed by the reporting agents in accordance
with this Regulation and with their national legal frameworks to the extent that they do not conflict with the provisions
of this Regulation. NCBs shall ensure that these reporting arrangements: (a) provide the required statistical information;
and (b) allow verification of the fact that the minimum standards for transmission, accuracy, compliance with concepts
and revisions specified in Annex V have been fulfilled.
3. The NCBs may use information obtained from any other sources, in line with Article 8(5), for their transmission
of credit data to the ECB, to the extent that the information meets the quality and timeliness standards that apply
according to this Regulation to data collected from reporting agents. In particular, the minimum standards for
transmission, accuracy and compliance with concepts and revisions specified in Annex V shall be fulfilled.
Article 15
Mergers, divisions and reorganisations
1. In the event of a merger, division or reorganisation that could affect the fulfilment of their statistical obligations,
the reporting agents concerned shall inform the relevant NCB of the procedures that are planned for fulfilling the
statistical reporting requirements set out in this Regulation, as soon as the intention to implement the merger, division
or reorganisation has been published and before it takes effect.
2. Without prejudice to the obligations set out in the previous paragraph, the relevant NCB may authorise the
acquiring institution to fulfil its statistical reporting obligation through temporary procedures. This exemption from
normal reporting procedures shall last no longer than six months from the date on which the merger, division or reorganisation
took place. This exemption shall be without prejudice to the obligation for the acquiring institution to fulfil
its reporting obligations in accordance with this Regulation.
1.6.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 144/53 
Article 16
Derogations and reduced reporting frequency
1. In order to ensure the proportionality of the reporting obligations established in this Regulation, the relevant NCB
may grant derogations to small reporting agents, provided that the combined contribution of all reporting agents that
are granted a derogation to the total outstanding amount of loans reported pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1071/2013
of the European Central Bank (ECB/2013/33) (
1
) by all reporting agents resident in the reporting Member State does not
exceed 2 %. The derogations may cover some or all reporting requirements defined in this Regulation.
2. In order to support the implementation of the reporting requirements, the relevant NCB may allow small
reporting agents to report credit data relating to reporting reference dates prior to 1 January 2021 on a quarterly
instead of a monthly basis, provided that the combined contribution of all agents reporting on a quarterly basis to the
total outstanding amount of loans reported pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1071/2013 by all reporting agents resident
in the reporting Member State does not exceed 4 %, without prejudice to their reporting credit data under any other
legal framework.
3. NCBs may grant derogations to reporting agents to the extent that the NCBs obtain data from other sources of the
quality and timeliness required according to Article 14(3).
4. NCBs shall inform the following reporting agents of their reporting obligations in accordance with Article 13(3):
(a) reporting agents that have been granted a derogation in line with paragraph 1;
(b) reporting agents that may report data on a reduced reporting frequency in line with paragraph 2;
(c) reporting agents that no longer fulfil the conditions for a derogation or reduced reporting frequency in line with
paragraph (1) or (2).
Article 17
Verification and compulsory collection and minimum quality standards
The NCBs shall verify and, to the extent necessary, carry out the compulsory collection of the information that reporting
agents are required to provide pursuant to this Regulation, without prejudice to the ECB's right to exercise these rights
itself. In particular, the NCBs shall exercise this right when a reporting agent does not fulfil the minimum standards for
transmission, accuracy, compliance with concepts and revisions specified in Annex V.
Article 18
Sanctions
The ECB may impose sanctions on reporting agents who fail to comply with the reporting obligations of this Regulation
in accordance with Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2533/98. Reporting agents shall not be subject to sanctions
insofar as they demonstrate that they are prevented from reporting the required information by the national law of a
country where the branch on which they are required to report information is resident. The ECB's power to impose
sanctions for non-compliance with the reporting obligations of this Regulation is independent of an NCB's right to
sanction, in line with its national law, non-compliance with statistical or other reporting obligations that apply to
reporting agents under the respective national legal framework in line with Article 8(3).

ANNEX I
Data to report and templates
1. The data to be reported under this Regulation refers to multiple elements, e.g. creditors, debtors, instruments,
protection, etc. that are interconnected. For example, one debtor may be granted multiple loans or a single
protection might secure multiple instruments. A data set for reporting the specific information for each of these
elements is set out in this Annex.
2. The information for each data set refers to a single element, e.g. instrument, or to the combination of several
elements, e.g. ‘instrument-protection’, thereby establishing the level of granularity to be provided for each data set.
The data sets are organised into two templates.
3. The reporting requirements for the data attributes included in each template are set out in Annexes II and III.
4. The data attributes included in each template are defined in Annex IV.
5. Amounts are reported in units of euro. Foreign currency amounts should be converted into euro at the respective
European Central Bank (ECB) euro foreign exchange reference rates, i.e. the mid-rate on the reporting reference
date.
Template 1
1. Counterparty reference data
1.1 The level of granularity for the counterparty reference data is the counterparty. Each record is uniquely
identified by the combination of the following data attributes: (a) reporting agent identifier; and
(b) counterparty identifier.
1.2 Each counterparty identifier must be unique for each counterparty reported by the same reporting agent and
each counterparty must always be identified by the reporting agent using its unique counterparty identifier.
This identifier must not be reused by the same reporting agent at any point in time to identify a different
counterparty. NCBs may require reporting agents to use counterparty identifiers as specified by the relevant
NCB.
1.3 The counterparties to be registered are all institutional units which are legal entities or form part of legal
entities and are linked to instruments reported pursuant to Articles 4 and 5 or provide protection to secure
such instruments. Specifically, the counterparties to be registered are: (a) creditors; (b) debtors; (c) protection
providers; (d) originators; (e) servicers; (f) head offices of undertakings; (g) immediate parent undertakings and
(h) ultimate parent undertakings. A single entity may be the counterparty in relation to several instruments or
take different roles as a counterparty for the same instrument. However, each counterparty should only be
registered once.
1.4 The information required for each type of counterparty is indicated in Annex III.
1.5 The counterparty data describes the characteristics of the counterparty.
1.6 In the case of natural persons being affiliated with instruments reported to AnaCredit, no record for the
natural persons must be reported.
1.7 The records must be reported no later than the monthly transmission of credit data relevant for the reporting
reference date on which the counterparty entered into a contract registered in AnaCredit. If a change takes
place, the records must be updated no later than the monthly transmission of credit data for the reporting
reference date on which the change came into effect.

2.2 Each contract identifier must be unique for each contract that generates credit risk for the same observed
agent. This identifier must not be reused at any point in time to identify a different contract with the same
observed agent. Each instrument identifier must be unique for each contract, i.e. all instruments embedded in a
single contract are to be assigned a different instrument identifier, and these must not be reused at any point in
time to identify a different instrument within the contract.
2.3 The instrument data registers any instrument that exists under a contract between the observed agent and the
counterparties, including all instruments between institutional units within the same legal entity.
2.4 The instrument data describes the features of the instrument, which rarely change over time.
2.5 The records must be reported no later than the monthly transmission of credit data relevant for the reporting
reference date on which the instrument is registered in AnaCredit. If a change takes place, the records must be
updated no later than the monthly transmission of credit data for the reporting reference date on or before
which the change came into effect.
3. Financial data
3.1 The level of granularity for the financial data is the instrument. Each record is uniquely identified by the
combination of the following data attributes: (a) reporting agent identifier; (b) observed agent identifier;
(c) contract identifier and (d) instrument identifier.

3.3 Any drawn amount of an instrument must be registered in the data attribute ‘outstanding nominal amount’.
Any committed undrawn amount of an instrument must be registered in the data attribute ‘off-balance-sheet
amount’.
3.4 The records must be reported on a monthly basis.
4. Counterparty-instrument data
4.1 The level of granularity for the counterparty-instrument data is the ‘counterparty-instrument’ combination and
each record is uniquely identified by the combination of the following data attributes: (a) reporting agent
identifier; (b) observed agent identifier; (c) counterparty identifier; (d) contract identifier; (e) instrument
identifier; and (f) counterparty role.

natural persons must be reported.
4.4 The records must be reported no later than the monthly transmission of credit data relevant for the reporting
reference date on or before which the instrument was registered in AnaCredit. If a change takes place, the
records must be updated no later than the date of the monthly transmission of credit data that is relevant for
the reporting reference date on or before which the change came into effect.
1.6.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 144/57

(2) The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is subject to reporting requirements under Article 15 of the
Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of
the ESCB’).
(3) Pursuant to Article 26.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Executive Board draws up a consolidated balance sheet of
the ESCB for analytical and operational purposes.
(4) Pursuant to Article 26.4 of the Statute of the ESCB, for the application of Article 26 the Governing Council
establishes the necessary rules for standardising the accounting and reporting of operations undertaken by the
national central banks (NCBs).
(5) The disclosure relating to euro banknotes in circulation, remuneration of net intra-Eurosystem claims/liabilities
resulting from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem, and monetary income should be
harmonised in the NCBs' published annual financial statements,
HAS ADOPTED THIS GUIDELINE:
CHAPTER I
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Article 1
Definitions
1. For the purposes of this Guideline:
(a) ‘NCB’ means the national central bank of a Member State whose currency is the euro;
(b) ‘Eurosystem accounting and financial reporting purposes’ means the purposes for which the ECB produces the
financial statements listed in Annex I in accordance with Articles 15 and 26 of the Statute of the ESCB;
20.12.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 347/37
(

) Guideline ECB/2010/20 of 11 November 2010 on the legal framework for accounting and financial reporting in the European System of
Central Banks (OJ L 35, 9.2.2011, p. 31). 
(c) ‘reporting entity’ means the ECB or an NCB;
(d) ‘quarterly revaluation date’ means the date of the last calendar day of a quarter;
(e) ‘cash changeover year’ means a period of 12 months from the date on which euro banknotes and coins acquire the
status of legal tender in a Member State whose currency is the euro;
(f) ‘banknote allocation key’ means the percentages that result from taking into account the ECB's share in the total
euro banknote issue and applying the subscribed capital key to the NCBs' share in such total, under Decision
ECB/2010/29 (
1
);
(g) ‘consolidation’ means the accounting process whereby the financial figures of various separate legal entities are
aggregated as though they were one entity;
(h) ‘credit institution’ means either: (a) a credit institution within the meaning of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (
2
), that is subject to supervision by a competent
authority; or (b) another credit institution within the meaning of Article 123(2) of the Treaty that is subject to
scrutiny of a standard comparable to supervision by a competent authority.
2. Definitions of other technical terms used in this Guideline are attached as Annex II.
Article 2
Scope of application
1. This Guideline shall apply to the ECB and to the NCBs for Eurosystem accounting and financial reporting
purposes.
2. This Guideline's scope of application shall be limited to the Eurosystem accounting and financial reporting regime
laid down by the Statute of the ESCB. As a consequence, it shall not apply to NCBs' national reports and financial
accounts. In order to achieve consistency and comparability between the Eurosystem and national regimes, it is
recommended that NCBs should, to the extent possible, follow the rules set out in this Guideline for their national
reports and financial accounts.
Article 3
Qualitative characteristics
The following qualitative characteristics shall apply:
(1) economic reality and transparency: the accounting methods and financial reporting shall reflect economic reality, be
transparent and respect the qualitative characteristics of understandability, relevance, reliability and comparability.
Transactions shall be accounted for and presented in accordance with their substance and economic reality and not
merely with their legal form;
(2) prudence: the valuation of assets and liabilities and income recognition shall be carried out prudently. In the context
of this Guideline, this implies that unrealised gains shall not be recognised as income in the profit and loss account,
but shall be recorded directly in a revaluation account and that unrealised losses shall be taken at year end to the
profit and loss account if they exceed previous revaluation gains registered in the corresponding revaluation account.
Hidden reserves or the deliberate misstatement of items on the balance sheet and in the profit and loss account shall
be inconsistent with the assumption of prudence;
(3) materiality: deviations from the accounting rules, including those affecting the calculation of the profit and loss
accounts of the individual NCBs and of the ECB, shall only be allowed if they can be reasonably considered as
immaterial in the overall context and presentation of the reporting entity's financial accounts;
(4) consistency and comparability: the criteria for balance sheet valuation and income recognition shall be applied
consistently in terms of commonality and continuity of approach within the Eurosystem to ensure comparability of
data in the financial statements.

Article 4
Basic accounting assumptions
The following basic accounting assumptions shall apply:
(1) going concern basis: accounts shall be prepared on a going concern basis;
(2) accruals principle: income and expenses shall be recognised in the accounting period in which they are earned or
incurred and not in the period in which they are received or paid;
(3) post-balance sheet events: assets and liabilities shall be adjusted for events that occur between the annual balance
sheet date and the date on which the financial statements are approved by the relevant bodies if they affect the
condition of assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date. No adjustment shall be made for assets and liabilities, but
disclosure shall be made of those events occurring after the balance sheet date if they do not affect the condition of
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, but which are of such importance that non-disclosure would affect the
ability of the users of the financial statements to make proper evaluations and decisions.
Article 5
Economic and cash/settlement approaches
1. The economic approach shall be used as the basis for recording foreign exchange transactions, financial
instruments denominated in foreign currency and related accruals. Two different techniques have been developed to
implement this approach:
(a) the ‘regular approach’ as set out in Chapters III and IV and Annex III; and
(b) the ‘alternative approach’ as set out in Annex III.
2. Securities transactions including equity instruments denominated in foreign currency may continue to be recorded
according to the cash/settlement approach. The related accrued interest including premiums or discounts shall be
recorded on a daily basis from the spot settlement date.
3. NCBs may use either the economic or the cash/settlement approach to record any specific euro-denominated
transactions, financial instruments and related accruals.
4. With the exception of quarter end and year end accounting adjustments and of items disclosed under ‘Other assets’
and ‘Other liabilities’, amounts presented as part of the daily financial reporting for Eurosystem financial reporting
purposes shall only show cash movements in balance sheet items. At quarter end and year end, the amortisation shall
also be included in the carrying value of securities.
Article 6
Recognition of assets and liabilities
A financial or other asset or liability shall only be recognised in the balance sheet of the reporting entity if all of the
following conditions are met:
(1) it is probable that any future economic benefit associated with the asset or liability will flow to or from the
reporting entity;
(2) substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the asset or liability have been transferred to the reporting
entity;
(3) the cost or value of the asset to the reporting entity or the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably.
20.12.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 347/39 
CHAPTER II
COMPOSITION AND VALUATION RULES FOR THE BALANCE SHEET
Article 7
Composition of the balance sheet
The composition of the balance sheet of the ECB and NCBs for Eurosystem financial reporting purposes shall be based
on the structure set out in Annex IV.
Article 8
Provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks
Taking into due consideration the nature of the activities of the NCBs, an NCB may establish a provision for foreign
exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks on its balance sheet. The NCB shall decide on the size and use of
the provision on the basis of a reasoned estimate of the NCB's risk exposure.
Article 9
Balance sheet valuation rules
1. Current market rates and prices shall be used for balance sheet valuation purposes unless specified otherwise in
Annex IV.
2. The revaluation of gold, foreign currency instruments, securities (other than securities classified as held-tomaturity,
non-marketable securities, and securities held for monetary policy purposes that are accounted for at
amortised costs), as well as financial instruments, both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet, shall be performed as at
the quarterly revaluation date at mid-market rates and prices. This shall not preclude reporting entities from revaluing
their portfolios on a more frequent basis for internal purposes, provided that they report items in their balance sheets
only at transaction value during the quarter.
3. No distinction shall be made between price and currency revaluation differences for gold, but a single gold
revaluation difference shall be accounted for, based on the euro price per defined unit of weight of gold derived from
the euro/US dollar exchange rate on the quarterly revaluation date. For foreign exchange, including on-balance-sheet and
off-balance-sheet transactions, revaluation shall take place on a currency-by-currency basis. For the purpose of this
Article, holdings of special drawing rights (SDRs), including designated individual foreign exchange holdings underlying
the SDR basket, shall be treated as one holding. For securities, revaluation shall take place on a code-by-code basis, i.e.
same International Securities Identification Number/type, while any embedded options will not be separated for
valuation purposes. Securities held for monetary policy purposes or included in the items ‘Other financial assets’ or
‘Sundry’ shall be treated as separate holdings.
4. Revaluation bookings shall be reversed at the end of the next quarter, except for unrealised losses taken to the
profit and loss account at the end of the year; any transactions during the quarter shall be reported at transaction prices
and rates.
5. Marketable securities held for monetary policy purposes shall be treated as separate holdings and shall be valued
either at market price or at amortised cost (subject to impairment), depending on monetary policy considerations.
6. Securities classified as held-to-maturity shall be treated as separate holdings and shall be valued at amortised cost
(subject to impairment). The same treatment shall apply to non-marketable securities. Securities classified as held-tomaturity
may be sold before their maturity when any of the following occurs:
(a) if the quantity sold is considered not significant in comparison with the total amount of the held-to-maturity
securities portfolio;
(b) if the securities are sold during one month before maturity date;
(c) under exceptional circumstances, such as a significant deterioration of the issuer's creditworthiness.
L 347/40 EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.12.2016 
Article 10
Reverse transactions
1. A reverse transaction conducted under a repo agreement shall be recorded as a collateralised inward deposit on the
liabilities side of the balance sheet, while the item that has been provided as collateral shall remain on the assets side of
the balance sheet. Securities sold which are to be repurchased under repo agreements shall be treated by the reporting
entity, which is required to repurchase them, as if the assets in question were still part of the portfolio from which they
were sold.
2. A reverse transaction conducted under a reverse repo agreement shall be recorded as a collateralised outward loan
on the assets side of the balance sheet for the amount of the loan. Securities acquired under reverse repo agreements
shall not be revalued and no profit or loss arising thereon shall be taken to the profit and loss account by the reporting
entity lending the funds.
3. In the case of security lending transactions, the securities shall remain on the transferor's balance sheet. Security
lending transactions where collateral is provided in the form of cash shall be accounted for in the same manner as that
prescribed for repurchase operations. Security lending transactions where collateral is provided in the form of securities
shall only be recorded on the balance sheet where cash:
(a) is exchanged as part of the settlement process; and
(b) remains on an account of either the lender or the borrower.
The transferee shall show a liability for the retransfer of the securities if in the meantime the securities have been sold.
4. Collateralised gold transactions shall be treated as repurchase agreements. The gold flows relating to these collateralised
transactions shall not be recorded in the financial statements and the difference between the spot and forward
prices of the transaction shall be treated on an accruals basis.
5. Reverse transactions conducted under an automated security lending programme (including security lending
transactions) shall be recorded on the balance sheet, as a minimum, at the end of the reporting period if collateral is
provided in the form of cash placed on an account of the relevant NCB or the ECB and this cash is still uninvested.
Article 11
Marketable equity instruments
1. This Article shall apply to marketable equity instruments, i.e. equity shares or equity funds, whether the
transactions are conducted directly by a reporting entity or by its agent, with the exception of activities conducted for
pension funds, participating interests, investments in subsidiaries or significant interests.
2. Equity instruments denominated in foreign currencies and disclosed under ‘Other assets’ shall not form part of the
overall currency position but shall be part of a separate currency holding. The calculation of the related foreign
exchange gains and losses may be performed either on a net average cost method or an average cost method.
3. The revaluation of equity portfolios shall be performed in accordance with Article 9(3). Revaluation shall take
place on an item-by-item basis. For equity funds, the price revaluation shall be performed on a net basis, and not on an
individual share-by-share basis. There shall be no netting between different equity shares or between different equity
funds.
4. Transactions shall be recorded in the balance sheet at transaction price.
5. Brokerage commission may be recorded either as a transaction cost to be included in the cost of the asset, or as an
expense in the profit and loss account.
6. The amount of the dividend purchased shall be included in the cost of the equity instrument. At ex-dividend date,
the amount of the dividend purchased may be treated as a separate item until the payment of the dividend has been
received.
20.12.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 347/41 
7. Accruals on dividends shall not be booked at end-of-period as they are already reflected in the market price of the
equity instruments with the exception of equities quoted ex-dividend.
8. Rights issues shall be treated as a separate asset when issued. The acquisition cost shall be calculated based on the
equity's existing average cost, on the new acquisition's strike price, and on the proportion between existing and new
equities. Alternatively, the price of the right may be based on the right's value in the market, the equity's existing average
cost and the equity's market price before the rights issue.
Article 12
Hedging of interest rate risk on securities with derivatives
1. Hedging of interest rate risk on a security with a derivative means designating a derivative so that the change in its
fair value offsets the expected change in the fair value of the hedged security arising from interest rate movements.
2. Hedged and hedging instruments shall be recognised and treated in accordance with the general provisions,
valuation rules, income recognition and instrument-specific requirements set out in this Guideline.
3. In derogation from Articles 3(2), 9(4), 15(1) and (2), 16(1)(b) and (2)(d), and 17(2), the following alternative
treatment may be applied to the valuation of a hedged security and of a hedging derivative:
(a) The security and the derivative shall both be revalued and shown at their market values on the balance sheet as at
the end of each quarter. The following asymmetric valuation approach shall be applied to the net amount of
unrealised gain or loss on the hedged and hedging instruments:
(i) a net unrealised loss shall be taken to the profit and loss account at year end and it is recommended that it is
amortised over the remaining life of the hedged instrument; and
(ii) a net unrealised gain shall be booked on a revaluation account and reversed at the following revaluation date.
(b) Hedge of a security already owned: if the average cost of a hedged security is different from the market price of the
security at the inception of the hedge, the following treatment shall be applied:
(i) unrealised gains of the security on that date shall be booked on a revaluation account while unrealised losses
shall be taken to the profit and loss account; and
(ii) the provisions of point (a) shall apply to the changes in market values following the inception date of the
hedging relationship.
(c) It is recommended that the balance of unamortised premiums and discounts, as at the date when the hedge was set
up, is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged instrument.
4. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the security and the derivative that have remained in the books of the
reporting entity shall be valued as standalone instruments as of the date of discontinuation in accordance with the
general rules set out in this Guideline.
5. The alternative treatment specified in paragraph 3 may only be applied if all of the following conditions are met:
(a) At the inception of the hedge there is formal documentation of the hedging relationship and the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. That documentation shall include all of the following: (i) identification
of the derivative used as a hedging instrument; (ii) identification of the related hedged security; and (iii) an
assessment of the derivative's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the security's fair value
attributable to the interest rate risk.
L 347/42 EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.12.2016 
(b) The hedge is expected to be highly effective and the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured. Both
prospective and retrospective effectiveness must be assessed. It is recommended that:
(i) the prospective effectiveness should be measured by comparing the past changes in the fair value of the hedged
item with past changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, or by demonstrating a high statistical
correlation between the fair value of the hedged item and the fair value of the hedging instrument; and
(ii) the retrospective effectiveness should be demonstrated if the ratio between the actual gain/loss on the hedged
item and the actual loss/gain on the hedging instrument is within the range of 80 %-125 %.
6. The following shall apply to the hedging of a group of securities: similar interest rate securities may be aggregated
and hedged as a group only if all of the following conditions are met:
(a) the securities have a similar duration;
(b) the group of securities complies with the effectiveness test prospectively and retrospectively;
(c) the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk for each security of the group is expected to be approximately
proportional to the overall change in the fair value attributable to the hedged risk of the group of securities.
Article 13
Synthetic instruments
1. Instruments combined to form a synthetic instrument shall be recognised and treated separately from other
instruments, in accordance with the general provisions, valuation rules, income recognition and instrument-specific
requirements set out in this Guideline.
2. In derogation from Article 3(b) and Articles 9(4), 15(1) and 17(2), the following alternative treatment may be
applied to the valuation of synthetic instruments:
(a) unrealised gains and losses of the instruments combined to form a synthetic instrument are netted at year end. In
this case, net unrealised gains shall be recorded in a revaluation account. Net unrealised losses shall be taken to the
profit and loss account if they exceed previous net revaluation gains registered in the corresponding revaluation
account;
(b) securities held as part of a synthetic instrument shall not form part of the overall holding of these securities but
shall be part of a separate holding;
(c) unrealised losses taken to the profit and loss account at year end and the corresponding unrealised gains shall be
separately amortised in subsequent years.
3. If one of the instruments combined expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, the reporting entity shall discontinue
prospectively the alternative treatment specified in paragraph 2 and any unamortised valuation gains credited in the
profit and loss account in previous years shall be immediately reversed.
4. The alternative treatment specified in paragraph 2 may only be applied if all of the following conditions are met:
(a) the individual instruments are managed and their performance is evaluated as one combined instrument, based on
either a risk management or investment strategy;
(b) on initial recognition, the individual instruments are structured and designated as a synthetic instrument;
(c) the application of the alternative treatment eliminates or significantly reduces a valuation inconsistency (valuation
mismatch) that would arise from applying general rules set out in this Guideline at an individual instrument level;
(d) the availability of formal documentation allows the fulfilment of the conditions set out in points (a), (b) and (c) to be
verified.

Article 14
Banknotes
1. For the implementation of Article 49 of the Statute of the ESCB, banknotes of other Member States whose
currency is the euro held by an NCB shall not be accounted for as banknotes in circulation, but as intra-Eurosystem
balances. The procedure for treating banknotes of other Member States whose currency is the euro shall be the
following:
(a) the NCB receiving banknotes denominated in national euro area currency units issued by another NCB shall notify
the issuing NCB on a daily basis of the value of banknotes paid in to be exchanged, unless a given daily volume is
low. The issuing NCB shall issue a corresponding payment to the receiving NCB via TARGET2; and
(b) the adjustment of the ‘banknotes in circulation’ figures shall take place in the books of the issuing NCB on receipt of
the abovementioned notification.
2. The amount of ‘banknotes in circulation’ in the balance sheets of NCBs shall be the result of three components:
(a) the unadjusted value of euro banknotes in circulation, including the cash changeover year banknotes denominated in
national euro area currency units for the NCB that adopts the euro, which shall be calculated according to either of
the following two methods:
Method A: B = P – D – N – S
Method B: B = I – R – N
Where:
B is the unadjusted value of ‘banknotes in circulation’;
P is the value of banknotes produced or received from the printer or other NCBs;
D is the value of banknotes destroyed;
N is the value of national banknotes of the issuing NCB held by other NCBs (notified but not yet repatriated);
I is the value of banknotes put into circulation;
R is the value of banknotes received;
S is the value of banknotes in stock/vault;
(b) minus the amount of the unremunerated claim vis-à-vis the ECI bank running the Extended Custodial Inventory
(ECI) programme, in the event of a transfer of ownership of the ECI programme-related banknotes;
(c) plus or minus the amount of the adjustments resulting from the application of the banknote allocation key.
CHAPTER III
INCOME RECOGNITION
Article 15
Income recognition
1. The following rules shall apply to income recognition:
(a) realised gains and realised losses shall be taken to the profit and loss account;
(b) unrealised gains shall not be recognised as income, but recorded directly in a revaluation account;
(c) at year end, unrealised losses shall be taken to the profit and loss account if they exceed previous revaluation gains
registered in the corresponding revaluation account;
(d) unrealised losses taken to the profit and loss account shall not be reversed in subsequent years against new
unrealised gains;
L 347/44 EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.12.2016 
(e) there shall be no netting of unrealised losses in any one security, or in any currency or in gold holdings against
unrealised gains in other securities or currencies or gold;
(f) at year end, impairment losses shall be taken to the profit and loss account and shall not be reversed in subsequent
years unless the impairment decreases and the decrease can be related to an observable event that occurred after the
impairment was first recorded.
2. Premiums or discounts arising on issued and purchased securities shall be calculated and presented as part of
interest income and shall be amortised over the remaining contractual life of the securities, either according to the
straight-line method or the internal rate of return (IRR) method. The IRR method shall, however, be mandatory for
discount securities with a remaining maturity of more than one year at the time of acquisition.
3. Accruals for financial assets and liabilities, e.g. interest payable and amortised premiums/discounts denominated in
foreign currency shall be calculated and recorded in the accounts on a daily basis, based on the latest available rates.
Accruals for financial assets and liabilities denominated in euro shall be calculated and recorded in the accounts at least
quarterly. Accruals for other items shall be calculated and recorded in the accounts at least annually.
4. Irrespective of the frequency of calculating accruals but subject to the exceptions referred to in Article 5(4)
reporting entities shall report data at transaction value during the quarter.
5. Accruals denominated in foreign currencies shall be translated at the exchange rate of the recording date and shall
have an impact on the currency position.
6. Generally, for the calculation of accruals during the year local practice may apply, i.e. they may be calculated until
either the last business day or the last calendar day of the quarter. However, at year end the mandatory reference date
shall be 31 December.
7. Currency outflows that entail a change in the holding of a given currency may give rise to realised foreign
exchange gains or losses.
Article 16
Cost of transactions
1. The following general rules shall apply to the cost of transactions:
(a) the average cost method shall be used on a daily basis for gold, foreign currency instruments and securities, to
compute the acquisition cost of items sold, having regard to the effect of exchange rate and/or price movements;
(b) the average cost of the asset or liability shall be reduced or increased by unrealised losses taken to the profit and loss
account at year end;
(c) in the case of the acquisition of coupon securities, the amount of coupon income purchased shall be treated as
a separate item. In the case of securities denominated in foreign currency, it shall be part of that currency's holding,
but shall not affect the average cost of the security or the relevant currency.
2. The following special rules shall apply to securities:
(a) transactions shall be recorded at the transaction price and booked in the financial accounts at the clean price;
(b) custody and management fees, current account fees and other indirect costs shall not be considered as transaction
costs and shall be included in the profit and loss account. They shall not be treated as part of the average cost of
a particular asset;
(c) income shall be recorded gross with refundable withholding and other taxes accounted for separately;
(d) for the purpose of calculating the average purchase cost of a security, either: (i) all purchases made during the day
shall be added, at their purchase price, to the previous day's holding to produce a new weighted average cost before
applying the sales for the same day; or (ii) individual purchases and sales of securities may be applied in the order in
which they occurred during the day for the purpose of calculating the revised average cost.
20.12.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 347/45 
3. The following special rules shall apply to gold and foreign exchange:
(a) transactions in a foreign currency which entail no change in the holding of that currency shall be translated into
euro, using the exchange rate of either the contract or settlement date, and shall not affect that holding's acquisition
cost;
(b) transactions in foreign currency which entail a change in the holding of that currency shall be translated into euro at
the exchange rate of the contract date;
(c) the settlement of the principal amounts resulting from reverse transactions in securities denominated in a foreign
currency or in gold shall be deemed not to entail a change in the holding of that currency or of gold;
(d) actual cash receipts and payments shall be translated at the exchange rate on the day on which settlement occurs;
(e) where a long position exists, net inflows of currencies and gold made during the day shall be added, at the average
rate or gold price of the inflows of the day for each respective currency and gold, to the previous day's holding, to
produce a new weighted average cost. In the case of net outflows, the calculation of the realised gain or loss shall be
based on the average cost of the respective currency or gold holding for the preceding day so that the average cost
remains unchanged. Differences in the average rate/gold price between inflows and outflows made during the day
shall also result in realised gains or losses. Where a liability situation exists in respect of a foreign currency or gold
position, the reverse treatment shall apply to the abovementioned approach. Thus the average cost of the liability
position shall be affected by net outflows, while net inflows shall reduce the position at the existing weighted
average cost and shall result in realised gains or losses;
(f) costs of foreign exchange transactions and other general costs shall be posted to the profit and loss account.
CHAPTER IV
ACCOUNTING RULES FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS
Article 17
General rules
1. Foreign exchange forward transactions, forward legs of foreign exchange swaps and other currency instruments
involving an exchange of one currency for another at a future date shall be included in the net foreign currency
positions for calculating average costs and foreign exchange gains and losses.
2. Interest rate swaps, futures, forward rate agreements, other interest rate instruments and options, with the
exception of options embedded in securities, shall be accounted for and revalued on an item-by-item basis. These
instruments shall be treated separately from on-balance-sheet items.
3. Profits and losses arising from off-balance-sheet instruments shall be recognised and treated in a similar manner to
on-balance-sheet instruments.
Article 18
Foreign exchange forward transactions
1. Forward purchases and sales shall be recognised in off-balance-sheet accounts from the trade date to the settlement
date at the spot rate of the forward transaction. Realised gains and losses on sale transactions shall be calculated using
the average cost of the currency position on the trade date in accordance with the daily netting procedure for purchases
and sales.
2. The difference between the spot and the forward rates shall be treated as interest payable or receivable on an
accruals basis.
3. At the settlement date the off-balance-sheet accounts shall be reversed.
4. The currency position shall be affected by forward transactions from the trade date at the spot rate.
L 347/46 EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.12.2016 
5. The forward positions shall be valued in conjunction with the spot position of the same currency, offsetting any
differences that may arise within a single currency position. A net loss balance shall be debited to the profit and loss
account when it exceeds previous revaluation gains registered in the revaluation account. A net profit balance shall be
credited to the revaluation account.
Article 19
Foreign exchange swaps
1. Forward and spot purchases and sales shall be recognised in on- balance-sheet accounts at the respective
settlement date.
2. Forward and spot purchases and sales shall be recognised in off- balance-sheet accounts from the trade date to the
settlement date at the spot rate of the transactions.
3. Sale transactions shall be recognised at the spot rate of the transaction. Therefore no gains and losses shall arise.
4. The difference between the spot and forward rates shall be treated as interest payable or receivable on an accruals
basis for both purchases and sales.
5. At the settlement date the off-balance-sheet accounts shall be reversed.
6. The foreign currency position shall only change as a result of accruals denominated in foreign currency.
7. The forward position shall be valued in conjunction with the related spot position.
Article 20
Futures contracts
1. Futures contracts shall be recorded on the trade date in off-balance-sheet accounts.
2. The initial margin shall be recorded as a separate asset if deposited in cash. If deposited in the form of securities it
shall remain unchanged in the balance sheet.
3. Daily changes in the variation margins shall be taken to the profit and loss account and shall affect the currency
position. The same procedure shall be applied on the closing day of the open position, regardless of whether or not
delivery takes place. If delivery does take place, the purchase or sale entry shall be made at market price.
4. Fees shall be taken to the profit and loss account.
Article 21
Interest rate swaps
1. Interest rate swaps shall be recorded on the trade date in off-balance-sheet accounts.
2. The current interest payments, either received or paid, shall be recorded on an accruals basis. Payments may be
settled on a net basis per interest rate swap, but accrued interest income and expense shall be reported on a gross basis.
3. Fees shall be taken to the profit and loss account.
4. Interest rate swaps that are not cleared through a central clearing counterparty shall be individually revalued and,
if necessary, translated into euro at the currency spot rate. It is recommended that unrealised losses taken to the profit
and loss account at year end should be amortised in subsequent years, that in the case of forward interest rate swaps the
amortisation should begin from the value date of the transaction and that the amortisation should be linear. Unrealised
revaluation gains shall be credited to a revaluation account.
20.12.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 347/47 
5. For interest rate swaps that are cleared through a central clearing counterparty:
(a) the initial margin shall be recorded as a separate asset if deposited in cash. If deposited in the form of securities, it
shall remain unchanged in the balance sheet;
(b) daily changes in the variation margins shall be recorded in the profit and loss account and shall affect the currency
position;
(c) the interest accrual component shall be separated from the realised result and recorded on a gross basis in the profit
and loss account.
Article 22
Forward rate agreements
1. Forward rate agreements shall be recorded on the trade date in off- balance-sheet accounts.
2. The compensation payment to be paid by one party to another at the settlement date shall be entered on the
settlement date in the profit and loss account. Payments shall not be recorded on an accruals basis.
3. If forward rate agreements in a foreign currency are held, compensation payments shall affect the currency
position. Compensation payments shall be translated into euro at the spot rate at the settlement date.
4. All forward rate agreements shall be individually revalued and, if necessary, translated into euro at the currency
spot rate. Unrealised losses taken to the profit and loss account at year end shall not be reversed in subsequent years
against unrealised profits unless the instrument is closed out or terminated. Unrealised revaluation gains shall be credited
to a revaluation account.
5. Fees shall be taken to the profit and loss account.
Article 23
Forward transactions in securities
Forward transactions in securities shall be accounted for in accordance with either of the following two methods:
1. Method A:
(a) forward transactions in securities shall be recorded in off-balance-sheet accounts from the trade date to the
settlement date, at the forward price of the forward transaction;
(b) the average cost of the holding of the traded security shall not be affected until settlement; the profit and loss
effects of forward sale transactions shall be calculated on the settlement date;
(c) at the settlement date the off-balance-sheet accounts shall be reversed and the balance on the revaluation
account, if any, shall be credited to the profit and loss account. The security purchased shall be accounted for
using the spot price on the maturity date (actual market price), while the difference compared with the original
forward price is recognised as a realised profit or loss;
(d) in the case of securities denominated in a foreign currency, the average cost of the net currency position shall not
be affected if the reporting entity already holds a position in that currency. If the bond purchased forward is
denominated in a currency in which the reporting entity does not hold a position, so that it is necessary to
purchase the relevant currency, the rules for the purchase of foreign currencies set out in Article 16(3)(e) shall
apply;
(e) forward positions shall be valued on an isolated basis against the forward market price for the remaining
duration of the transaction. A revaluation loss at year end shall be debited to the profit and loss account, and
a revaluation profit shall be credited to the revaluation account. Unrealised losses recognised in the profit and
loss account at year end shall not be reversed in subsequent years against unrealised profits unless the instrument
is closed out or terminated.
L 347/48 EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.12.2016 
2. Method B:
(a) forward transactions in securities shall be recorded in off-balance-sheet accounts from the trade date to the
settlement date at the forward price of the forward transaction. At the settlement date the off-balance-sheet
accounts shall be reversed;
(b) at quarter end, a security shall be revalued on the basis of the net position resulting from the balance sheet and
from the sales of the same security recorded in the off-balance-sheet accounts. The amount of the revaluation
shall be equal to the difference between this net position valued at the revaluation price and the same position
valued at the average cost of the balance sheet position. At the quarter end, forward purchases shall be subject to
the revaluation process described in Article 9. The revaluation result shall be equal to the difference between the
spot price and the average cost of the purchase commitments;
(c) the result of a forward sale shall be recorded in the financial year in which the commitment was undertaken. This
result shall be equal to the difference between the initial forward price and the average cost of the balance sheet
position, or the average cost of the off-balance-sheet purchase commitments if the balance sheet position is
insufficient, at the time of the sale.
Article 24
Options
1. Options shall be recognised in off-balance-sheet accounts from the trade date to the exercise or expiry date at the
strike price of the underlying instrument.
2. Premiums denominated in foreign currency shall be translated into euro at the exchange rate of either the contract
or settlement date. The premium paid shall be recognised as a separate asset, while the premium received shall be
recognised as a separate liability.
3. If the option is exercised, the underlying instrument shall be recorded in the balance sheet at the strike price plus
or minus the original premium value. The original option premium amount shall be adjusted on the basis of unrealised
losses taken to the profit and loss account at year end.
4. If the option is not exercised, the option premium amount, adjusted on the basis of previous year-end unrealised
losses, shall be taken to the profit and loss account translated at the exchange rate available on the expiry date.
5. The currency position shall be affected by the daily variation margin for futures-style options, by any year-end
write-down of the option premium, by the underlying trade at exercise date or, at the expiry date, by the option
premium. Daily changes in the variation margins shall be taken to the profit and loss account.
6. With the exception of options embedded in securities, every option contract shall be individually revalued.
Unrealised losses taken to the profit and loss account shall not be reversed in subsequent years against unrealised gains.
Unrealised revaluation gains shall be credited to a revaluation account. There shall be no netting of unrealised losses in
any one option against unrealised gains in any other option.
7. For the application of paragraph 6, the market values are the quoted prices when such prices are available from an
exchange, dealer, broker or similar entities. When quoted prices are not available, the market value is determined
through a valuation technique. This valuation technique shall be used consistently over time and it shall be possible to
demonstrate that it provides reliable estimates of prices that would be obtained in actual market transactions.
8. Fees shall be taken to the profit and loss account.
CHAPTER V

Article 29
Transitional rules
1. NCBs shall revalue all financial assets and liabilities as at the date on which they become members of the
Eurosystem. Unrealised gains which arose before or on that date shall be separated from any unrealised revaluation gains
that may arise thereafter, and shall remain with the NCBs. The market prices and rates applied by the NCBs in the
opening balance sheets at the start of Eurosystem participation shall be considered as the average cost of these NCBs'
assets and liabilities.
2. It is recommended that unrealised gains which arose before or at the start of an NCB's Eurosystem membership
should not be considered as distributable at the time of the transition and that they should only be treated as realisable
or distributable in the context of transactions that occur after entry into the Eurosystem.
3. Foreign exchange, gold and price gains and losses, arising as a result of the transfer of assets from NCBs to the
ECB, shall be considered as realised.
4. This Article shall be without prejudice to any decision adopted under Article 30 of the Statute of the ESCB.

— Automated security lending programme (ASLP): a programme offered by a specialised institution, e.g. a bank which
arranges and handles security lending between programme participants, in the form of repo, combined repo and
reverse repo or security lending transactions. In the case of a principal-based programme, the specialised institution
offering this programme is considered the final counterparty, while in the case of an agency-based programme the
specialised institution offering this programme acts only as an agent, and the final counterparty is the entity with
which the security lending is effectively conducted.
— Average cost: the weighted average method, by which the cost of every purchase is added to the existing book value
to produce a new weighted average cost of a currency position, gold, debt or equity instrument.
— Capital key: the percentage shares of the shareholdings of each national central bank (NCB) in the European Central
Bank.
— Cash/settlement approach: an accounting approach under which accounting events are recorded at the settlement date.
— Central clearing counterparty: a legal person that interposes itself between the counterparties to contracts traded on
one or more financial markets, becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer.
— Clean price: the transaction price excluding any rebate/accrued interest, but including transaction costs that form part
of the price.
— Compensatory amount: an adjustment made in the calculation of monetary income in line with Decision (EU)
2016/2248 of the European Central Bank (ECB/2016/36) (
1
).
— Discount: the difference between the par value of a security and its price when this price is lower than par.
— Discount security: an asset which does not pay coupon interest, and the return on which is achieved by capital
appreciation because the asset is issued or bought at a discount from its nominal or par value.
— Earmarked portfolio: earmarked investment held on the assets side of the balance sheet as a counterpart fund,
consisting of debt securities, equity instruments, fixed-term deposits and current accounts, participating interests
and/or investments in subsidiaries. It matches an identifiable item on the liabilities side of the balance sheet,
irrespective of any legal, statutory or other constraints.
— Economic approach: an accounting approach under which deals are recorded on the trade or transaction date.
— Emergency liquidity assistance (ELA): Assistance given to a solvent financial institution, or group of solvent financial
institutions, that is facing temporary liquidity problems. ELA is provided by the NCBs with the approval of the
Governing Council.
— Equity instruments: dividend-bearing securities, i.e. corporate shares, and securities evidencing an investment in an
equity fund.

— Financial liability: any liability that is a legal obligation to deliver cash or another financial instrument to another
undertaking or to exchange financial instruments with another undertaking under conditions that are potentially
unfavourable.
— Foreign currency holding: the net position in the respective currency. For the purpose of this definition, special
drawing rights (SDRs) are considered as a separate currency; transactions that entail a change of the net position in
SDRs are either transactions denominated in SDRs or transactions in foreign exchange replicating the basket
composition of the SDRs (having regard to the relevant basket definition and weightings).
— Foreign exchange forward: a contract in which the outright purchase or sale of a certain amount denominated in
a foreign currency against another currency, usually the domestic currency, is agreed on a particular day and the
amount is to be delivered at a specified future date, more than two working days after the date of the contract, at
a given price. This forward rate of exchange consists of the prevailing spot rate plus/minus an agreed premium/
discount.
— Foreign exchange swap: the simultaneous spot purchase or sale of one currency against another (short leg) and
forward sale or purchase of the same amount of this currency against the other currency (long leg).
— Forward rate agreement: a contract in which two parties agree the interest rate to be paid on a notional deposit of
a specified maturity on a specific future date. At the settlement date compensation has to be paid by one party to
the other, depending on the difference between the contracted interest rate and the market rate on the settlement
date.
— Forward transactions in securities: over-the-counter contracts in which the purchase or sale of an interest rate
instrument, usually a bond or note, is agreed on the contract date to be delivered at a future date, at a given price.
— Futures contract: an exchange-traded forward contract. In such a contract, the purchase or sale of an underlying
instrument is agreed on the contract date to be delivered at a future date, at a given price. Usually no actual delivery
takes place as the contract is closed out before the agreed maturity.
— Futures-style option: a listed option where a variation margin is paid or received on a daily basis.
— Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP): a common set of accounting principles, standards and procedures that
entities use to prepare their financial statements. GAAP are a combination of authoritative standards (set by policy
boards) and commonly accepted ways of recording and reporting accounting information.
— Hedging: the process of offsetting the risks on financial or other assets or liabilities against one another, so as to
reduce the overall consequences of adverse movements in prices, interest rates or exchange rates.
— Held-to-maturity securities: securities with fixed or determinable payments and a fixed maturity, which the reporting
entity intends to hold until maturity.
— Impairment: a decline of the recoverable amount below the carrying amount.

reverse transactions that are aimed at providing liquidity with a maturity longer than that of the main refinancing
operations to the financial sector.
— Main refinancing operation (MRO): a regular open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in the form of
a reverse transaction. MROs are conducted through weekly standard tenders and normally have a maturity of one
week.
— Market price: the price that is quoted for a gold, foreign exchange or securities instrument usually excluding accrued
or rebate interest either on an organised market, e.g. a stock exchange or a non-organised market, e.g. an over-thecounter
market.
— Maturity date: the date on which the nominal/principal value becomes due and payable in full to the holder.
— Mid-market price: the mid-point between the bid price and the offer price for a security based on quotations for
transactions of normal market size by recognised market-makers or recognised trading exchanges, which is used for
the quarterly revaluation procedure.
— Mid-market rates: the euro foreign exchange reference rates that are generally based on the regular concertation
procedure between central banks within and outside the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), which normally
takes place at 14.15 Central European Time, and which are used for the quarterly revaluation procedure.
— Monetary income: The income accruing to the NCBs in the performance of the ESCB's monetary policy function.
Monetary income is pooled and allocated amongst the NCBs at the end of each financial year.
— Option: a contract that provides the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific amount of
a given stock, commodity, currency, index, or debt, at a specified price during a specified period of time or on the
date of expiration.
— Premium: the difference between the par value of a security and its price when this price is higher than par.
— Provisions: amounts set aside before arriving at the profit or loss figure in order to provide for any known or
expected liability or risk, the cost of which cannot be accurately determined (see Reserves). Provisions for future
liabilities and charges may not be used to adjust the value of assets.
— Realised gains/losses: gains/losses arising out of the difference between the sale price of a balance sheet item and its
adjusted cost.
— Repurchase agreement (repo): an arrangement with the economic purpose of borrowing money whereby an asset,
usually a fixed income security, is sold to a buyer without any retention of ownership on the part of the seller, while
the seller simultaneously obtains the right and the obligation to repurchase an equivalent asset at a specific price on
a future date or on demand.
— Reserves: an amount set aside out of distributable profits which is not intended to meet any specific liability,
contingency or expected diminution in the value of assets known to exist at the balance sheet date.
20.12.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 347/55 
— Revaluation accounts: balance sheet accounts for registration of the difference in the value of an asset or liability
between the adjusted cost of its acquisition and its valuation at an end-of-period market price, when the latter is
higher than the former in the case of assets, and when the latter is lower than the former in the case of liabilities.
They include differences in price quotations and/or market exchange rates.
— Reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo): a contract under which a cash holder agrees to the purchase of an asset and,
simultaneously, agrees to resell the asset for an agreed price on demand, after a stated time, or in the event of
a particular contingency. Sometimes a repo transaction is agreed via a third party (triparty repo).
— Reverse transaction: an operation whereby a reporting entity buys (reverse repo) or sells (repo) assets under
a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral.
— Settlement: an act that discharges obligations in respect of funds or assets transfers between two or more parties. In
the context of intra-Eurosystem transactions, settlement refers to the elimination of the net balances arising from
intra-Eurosystem transactions and requires the transfer of assets.
— Settlement date: the date on which the final and irrevocable transfer of value has been recorded in the books of the
relevant settlement institution. The settlement's timing can be immediate (real-time), same day (end-of-day) or an
agreed date after the date on which the commitment has been entered into.
— Spot rate: the rate at which a transaction settles on the spot settlement date. In relation to foreign exchange forward
transactions, the spot rate is the rate to which the forward points are applied in order to derive the forward rate.
— Spot settlement date: the date on which a spot transaction in a financial instrument is settled in accordance with
prevailing market conventions for that financial instrument.
— Straight-line method: depreciation or amortisation is determined over a given period by dividing the cost of the asset,
less its estimated residual value, by the estimated useful life of the asset pro rata temporis.
— Strike price: the specified price on an option contract at which the option may be exercised.
— Synthetic instrument: a financial instrument created artificially by combining two or more instruments with the aim
of replicating the cash flow and valuation patterns of another instrument. This is normally done via a financial
intermediary.

ANNEX III
DESCRIPTION OF THE ECONOMIC APPROACH
(including the ‘regular’ and ‘alternative’ approaches referred to in Article 5)
1. Trade date accounting
1.1. Trade date accounting may be implemented either by the ‘regular approach’ or the ‘alternative approach’.
1.2. Article 5(1)(a) refers to the ‘regular approach’.
1.2.1 Transactions are recorded on off-balance-sheet accounts on the trade date.
On the settlement date the off-balance-sheet booking entries are reversed, and the transactions are booked on
balance sheet accounts.
1.2.2 The foreign currency positions are affected on the trade date.
Consequently, realised gains and losses arising from net sales are also calculated on the trade date. Net purchases
of foreign currency affect the currency holding's average cost at the trade date.
1.3. Article 5(1)(b) refers to the ‘alternative approach’.
1.3.1 Contrary to the ‘regular approach’, there is no daily off-balance-sheet booking of the agreed transactions which
are settled at a later date. The recognition of realised income and the calculation of new average costs is
conducted at the settlement date (
1
).
1.3.2 For transactions agreed in 1 year but maturing in a subsequent year, the income recognition is treated according
to the ‘regular approach’. This means that realised effects from sales impact on the profit and loss accounts of the
year in which the transaction was agreed and purchases change the average cost of a holding in the year in which
the transaction was agreed.
1.4. The following table shows the main characteristics of the two techniques developed for individual foreign
exchange instruments and for securities.
TRADE DATE ACCOUNTING
‘Regular approach’ ‘Alternative approach’
Foreign exchange spot transactions — treatment during the year
Foreign exchange purchases are booked off-balancesheet
at trade date and affect the average cost of the
foreign currency position from this date.
Gains and losses arising from sales are considered as
realised at transaction or trade date. At settlement date,
the off-balance-sheet entries are reversed and on-balance-sheet
entries are made.
Foreign exchange purchases are booked on the balance
sheet at settlement date, affecting the average cost of
the foreign currency position from this date.
Gains and losses arising from sales are considered as
realised at settlement date. At trade date, no on-balance-sheet
accounting entry is made.
Foreign exchange forward transactions — treatment during the year
Treated in the same way as described above for spot
transactions, being recorded at the spot rate of the
transaction
Foreign exchange purchases are booked off-balancesheet
at the spot settlement date of the transaction, affecting
the average cost of the foreign currency position
from this date and at the spot rate of the transaction.
20.12.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 347/57
(
1
) In the case of foreign exchange forward transactions the currency holding is affected on the spot settlement date, i.e. usually trade
date + 2 days. 
TRADE DATE ACCOUNTING
‘Regular approach’ ‘Alternative approach’
Foreign exchange sales are booked off-balance-sheet at
the spot settlement date of the transaction. Gains and
losses are considered as realised at the spot settlement
date of the transaction.
At settlement date, the off-balance-sheet entries are reversed
and on-balance-sheet entries are made.
For period-end treatment see below.
Foreign exchange spot and forward transactions initiated in year 1 with the spot settlement date of the
transaction in year 2
No special arrangement is needed because transactions
are booked at trade date and gains and losses are recognised
at that date.
Should be treated as under the ‘regular approach’ (*):
— Foreign exchange sales are booked off-balance-sheet
in year 1 in order to report the foreign exchange realised
gains/losses in the financial year in which the
transaction was agreed.
— Foreign exchange purchases are booked off-balance-sheet
in year 1 affecting the average cost of
the foreign currency position from this date.
— Year-end revaluation of a currency holding must
take into account net purchases/sales with a spot
settlement date in the following financial year.
Securities transactions — treatment during the year
Purchases and sales are recognised off-balance-sheet at
trade date. Gains and losses are also recognised at this
date. At settlement date the off-balance-sheet entries
are reversed, and on-balance-sheet entries are made, i.e.
the same treatment as foreign exchange spot transactions.

All transactions are recorded at settlement date; however
see below for period-end treatment. Consequently
the impact on the average cost, in the event of purchases,
and gains/losses, in the event of sales, is recognised
at settlement date.
Securities transactions initiated in year 1 with the spot settlement date of the transaction in year 2
No special treatment required as transactions and consequences
are already booked at trade date.
Realised gains and losses are recognised in year 1 at the
period end, i.e. the same treatment as foreign exchange
spot transactions, and purchases are included in the
year-end revaluation process (*)
(*) The principle of materiality may be applied where these transactions have no material impact on the foreign currency position
and/or in the profit and loss account.
2. Daily booking of accrued interest, including premiums or discounts
2.1. Interest, premium or discount accrued related to financial instruments denominated in foreign currency is
calculated and booked on a daily basis, independently of real cash flow. This means that the foreign currency
position is affected when this accrued interest is booked, as opposed to only when the interest is received or
paid (
2
).
L 347/58 EN Official Journal of the European Union 20.12.2016
(
2
) Two possible approaches for the recognition of accruals have been identified. The first is the ‘calendar day approach’ where the accruals
are recorded every calendar day independently of whether a day is a weekend day, a bank holiday or a business day. The second is the
‘business day approach’ in which accruals are only booked on business days. There is no preference regarding the choice of approach.
However, if the last day of the year is not a business day it needs to be included in the calculation of accruals in either approach. 
2.2. Coupon accruals and amortisation of premium or discount are calculated and booked from the settlement date of
the purchase of the security until the settlement date of sale, or until the contractual maturity date.
2.3. The table below outlines the impact of the daily booking of accruals on the foreign exchange holding, e.g.
interest payable and amortised premium/discounts:
Daily booking of accrued interest as part of the economic approach
Accruals for foreign exchange denominated instruments are calculated and booked daily at the exchange rate of
the recording day.
Impact on the foreign exchange holding
Accruals affect the foreign currency position at the time they are booked, not being reversed later on. The accrual
is cleared when the actual cash is received or paid. At settlement date there is thus no effect on the foreign currency
position, since the accrual is included in the position being revalued at the periodic revaluation.

DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
of 3 November 1998
as amended by Decision of 14 December 2000
on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of participating Member States
andlosses of the ECB for the financial years 1999 to 2001
(ECB/2000/19)
(2000/825/EC)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL
BANK,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central
Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter referred
to as the ‘Statute’) and in particular to Article 32 and the fifth
paragraph of Article 34.2 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 32.2 of the Statute, the amount of
monetary income of each participating national central
bank (NCB) shall be equal to its annual income derived
from its assets held against notes in circulation and
deposit liabilities to credit institutions. According to
Article 32.3 of the Statute, if the balance-sheet structures
of participating NCBs after the start of the third stage do
not permit the application of the method foreseen in
Article 32.2 of the Statute for the allocation of monetary
income of participating NCBs, the Governing Council
may temporarily adopt an alternative method.
(2) According to Article 32.4 of the Statute, the amount of
each participating NCB's monetary income shall be
reduced by an amount equivalent to any interest paid by
that NCB on its deposit liabilities to credit institutions in
accordance with Article 19 of the Statute. According to
Article 32.5of the Statute, the sum of the participating
NCBs' monetary income shall be allocated to the participating
NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the
capital of the ECB.
(3) According to Articles 32.6 and 32.7 of the Statute, it is
for the Governing Council of the ECB to arrange for the
clearing and settlement at the ECB of the balances
arising from the allocation of monetary income and to
take all other measures necessary for the application of
Article 32 of the Statute.
(4) Article 10.3 of the Statute stipulates that for any
decision taken under Article 32 of the Statute, the votes
of the Governing Council of the ECB shall be weighted
according to the NCBs' shares in the subscribed capital
of the ECB.
(5) Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on
the introduction of the euro (1), in particular Articles 1,
9 and 10 thereof, has provided for a continuation,
during the transitional period (i.e. the period between 1
January 1999 and 31 December 2001), of the territorial
limits for the legal-tender status of banknotes denominated
in a national currency unit. Such national banknotes
are issued by the participating NCBs. Banknotes
denominated in euro will only be put into circulation on
1 January 2002. During the transitional period the
ESCB's monetary policy function is unlikely to have any
material impact on banknotes in circulation.
(6) The introduction of the euro in Greece on 1 January
2001 has entailed the need for adapting numerous ECB
legal acts and also this Decision. This Decision should
consequently enter into force on the abovementioned
date,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1
Definitions
For the purposes of this Decision:
— ‘equivalent claims’ shall mean the claims of the participating
NCBs against the ECB arising from the transfer of foreignreserve
assets from the NCBs to the ECB under Article 30
of the Statute,
— ‘euro area financial sector counterparties’ shall mean (i)
credit institutions as defined in Article 1(1) of Directive
2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of
the business of credit institutions (2), other than participating
NCBs, the registered or head office of which is
located in a participating Member State; and (ii) branches of
credit institutions, as defined in Article 1(3) of Directive
2000/12/EC in a participating Member State, which have
neither their registered nor their head office in a participating
Member State,
— ‘HBS’ shall mean the harmonised balance sheet as structured
in Annex IX of Guideline ECB/2000/18 of 1
December 1998 on the legal framework of accounting and
reporting in the European System of Central Banks (3), as
amended on 15December 1999 and on 14 December
2000,
— ‘liability base’ shall be the amount of qualifying liabilities,
within the balance sheet of each participating NCB, specified
in accordance with the Annex to this Decision,
(

(
1) OJ L 139, 11.5.1998, p. 1. (3) Not yet published in the Official Journal.
L 336/120 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 30.12.2000
— ‘participating NCB’ shall mean a national central bank of a
Member State which has adopted the single currency in
accordance with the Treaty establishing the European
Community,
— ‘reference rate’ shall be the latest available interest rate used
by the ESCB in its main refinancing operations under paragraph
3.1.2 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2000/7 of 31
August 2000 on monetary policy instruments and
procedures of the Eurosystem (1),
— ‘transitional period’, shall mean the period between 1
January 1999 and 31 December 2001.
Article 2
Methodfor measuring monetary income
1. During the transitional period, the amount of each participating
NCB's monetary income shall be determined in accordance
with the following formula:
MI = [LB × RR]
where:
— MI is the amount of each participating NCB's monetary
income to be pooled,
— LB is the liability base of each participating NCB, and
— RR is the reference rate.
2. The amount of each participating NCB's monetary
income shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to any
interest paid on liabilities included within the liability base.
Article 3
Calculation andallocation of monetary income
1. The calculation of each participating NCB's monetary
income shall be effected by the ECB on a daily basis. The
calculation shall be based on accounting data reported by
participating NCBs to the ECB under Guideline ECB/2000/18.
2. The sum of each participating NCB's monetary income
shall be allocated to the participating NCBs in proportion to
their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB. Such allocation
of monetary income shall take place at the end of each financial
year. The ECB shall inform the NCBs of the cumulative
amounts on a quarterly basis.
3. The amount of monetary income to be allocated to each
participating NCB shall be adjusted in accordance with any
decision by the Governing Council of the ECB made in relation
to the second paragraph of Article 32.4 of the Statute.
4. The amount of monetary income to be allocated to each
participating NCB shall be offset against the amounts due by
the same participating NCB as calculated in accordance with
Article 2. The net balances arising from the allocation of
monetary income shall be settled at the ECB.
Article 4
Transitional direct charge on income accruing to participating
NCBs from national banknotes in circulation
1. There shall be a charge on income accruing to each
participating NCB from assets held against national banknotes
in circulation (NCB's seigniorage). Such charge shall give the
ECB the right to access an NCB's seigniorage with the exclusive
purpose of covering those losses of the ECB that cannot be
funded during the financial years 1999, 2000 and 2001 either
(i) in the manner outlined under Article 33.2 of the Statute; or
(ii) against that portion of the equivalent claims which can be
partially offset against foreign-exchange losses under the Guideline
ECB/2000/15of 3 November 1998 as amended by the
Guideline of 16 November 2000 on the composition, valuation
and modalities for the initial transfer of foreign reserve assets,
and the denomination and remuneration of equivalent
claims (2).
2. The Governing Council of the ECB, in addition to
approving the annual accounts of the ECB each financial year,
shall decide the amount of the charge and establish the modalities
for settlement of unfunded losses.
3. The amount of the charge shall have a maximum upper
limit equivalent to the increase in the total monetary income of
the ESCB that would have arisen if banknotes denominated in
national currency units had been included in the liability base.
The amount of the charge of each participating NCB shall be in
proportion to its key for subscription to the capital of the ECB.
This limit shall be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure
that no participating NCB shall be liable for more than the total
of its seigniorage income from national banknotes in circulation
for the relevant financial year. For the purposes of this
paragraph, national seigniorage shall be calculated by applying
the reference rate to the amount of national banknotes in
circulation.
Article 5
Final provisions
This Decision, as amended by Decision ECB/2000/NP17, shall
enter into force on 1 January 2001.
This Decision applies to the financial years of 1999, 2000 and
2001.

GUIDELINES
GUIDELINE (EU) 2015/510 OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
of 19 December 2014
on the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework (ECB/2014/60)
(recast)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first indent of
Article 127(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in
particular the first indent of Article 3.1, Articles 9.2, 12.1, 14.3, 18.2 and the first paragraph of Article 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Guideline ECB/2011/14 (
1
) has been substantially amended. Since further amendments are to be made, it should
be recast in the interest of clarity.
(2) Achieving a single monetary policy entails defining the tools, instruments and procedures to be used by the
Eurosystem, which consists of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of those Member
States whose currency is the euro (hereinafter the ‘NCBs’), in order to implement such a policy in a uniform
manner throughout the Member States whose currency is the euro.
(3) According to Article 127(1) and (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 3.1 of
the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute
of the ESCB’), the primary objective of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is to maintain price stability,
and, as such, it has the basic tasks of defining and implementing the monetary policy of the Union and
conducting foreign-exchange operations consistent with the provisions of Article 219 of the Treaty.
(4) The general framework of the Eurosystem is based on provisions laid down in the Statute of the ESCB. Under
Article 127(1) of the Treaty and, as reflected in the Statute of the ESCB, the Eurosystem is required to act in
accordance with certain principles, including the principles of an open market economy with free competition,
favouring an efficient allocation of resources.
(5) To the extent deemed possible and appropriate, and with a view to ensuring operational efficiency, the ECB has
recourse to the NCBs for carrying out the operations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem pursuant to
the principle of decentralisation laid down in Article 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB and subject to the
conditions laid down in Article 14.3 of the Statute of the ESCB.
(6) In the light of Article 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the ECB has the authority to formulate the single
monetary policy of the Union and to issue the necessary guidelines to ensure its proper implementation. In
accordance with Article 14.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, the NCBs have an obligation to act in accordance with
such guidelines. This Guideline is therefore addressed to the Eurosystem. The rules laid down in this Guideline
will be implemented by the NCBs in contractual or regulatory arrangements. Counterparties will be required to
comply with those rules as implemented by the NCBs in those contractual or regulatory arrangements.
(7) The first indent of Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB allows the Eurosystem to operate in the financial
markets by buying and selling outright (spot and forward) or under repurchase agreements and by lending or
borrowing claims and marketable instruments, whether in euro or other currencies, as well as precious metals.
The second indent of Article 18.1 allows the Eurosystem to conduct credit operations with credit institutions and
other market participants.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/3
(
1
) Guideline ECB/2011/14 of 20 September 2011 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem (OJ L 331,
14.12.2011, p. 1). 
(8) In implementing its monetary policy, the Eurosystem employs the following monetary policy tools: it conducts
open market operations, offers standing facilities and requires credit institutions to hold minimum reserves on
accounts with the Eurosystem.
(9) In order to achieve its objectives, the Eurosystem has a set of instruments at its disposal for conducting open
market operations, which include reverse transactions, outright transactions, the issuance of ECB debt certificates,
foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes and the collection of fixed-term deposits. Such instruments
for the conduct of open market operations aim to ensure an orderly functioning of the money market and to
help banks meet their liquidity needs in a smooth and well-organised manner.
(10) The set of instruments at the Eurosystem's disposal for offering standing facilities are the marginal lending facility
and the deposit facility, which are aimed at providing and absorbing overnight liquidity respectively, signalling the
stance of monetary policy and bounding overnight money market interest rates.
(11) The Eurosystem's minimum reserve system primarily pursues the monetary policy objectives of: (a) contributing
to the stabilisation of money market interest rates by giving institutions an incentive to temper the effects of
temporary liquidity fluctuations due to the averaging provision; and (b) creating or enlarging a structural liquidity
shortage, which improves the ability of the Eurosystem to operate efficiently as a liquidity supplier. The legal
framework of the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system is laid down in Article 19 of the Statute of the ESCB,
Council Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 (
1
) and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank
(ECB/2003/9) (
2
).
(12) With regard to their aims, regularity and procedures, the Eurosystem's open market operations can be divided
into four categories: (a) main refinancing operations; (b) longer-term refinancing operations; (c) fine-tuning
operations; (d) structural operations.
(13) The main refinancing operations are a category of open market operations conducted by the Eurosystem that
play a pivotal role in pursuing the aims of steering interest rates, managing the liquidity situation in the market
and signalling the stance of monetary policy.
(14) The longer-term refinancing operations are aimed at providing counterparties with liquidity that has a maturity
longer than that of the main refinancing operations. With longer-term refinancing operations, the Eurosystem
does not, as a rule, intend to send signals to the market and therefore normally acts as a rate taker.
(15) Fine-tuning operations are executed on an ad hoc basis with the aim of managing the liquidity situation in the
market and steering interest rates, in particular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by
unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market. The specific fine-tuning operations are adapted to the types of
transactions and the specific objectives pursued by the relevant operations.
(16) Structural operations may be carried out whenever the structural position of the Eurosystem needs to be adjusted
with regard to the financial sector.
(17) The implementation of the Eurosystem's monetary policy framework should ensure that a broad range of
counterparties participate under uniform eligibility criteria. These criteria are specified to ensure the equal
treatment of counterparties across the Member States whose currency is the euro and to ensure that counterparties
fulfil certain prudential and operational requirements.
(18) In order to protect the Eurosystem from counterparty risk, the second indent of Article 18.1 of the Statute of the
ESCB provides that when the Eurosystem conducts credit operations with credit institutions and other market
participants, lending should be based on adequate collateral.
(19) In order to ensure the equal treatment of counterparties, as well as to enhance operational efficiency and
transparency, assets must fulfil certain uniform criteria across the Member States whose currency is the euro in
order to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations.

) Council Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the application of minimum reserves by the European Central
Bank (OJ L 318, 27.11.1998, p. 1).
(
2
) Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank of 12 September 2003 on the application of minimum reserves
(ECB/2003/9) (OJ L 250, 2.10.2003, p. 10). 
(20) The Eurosystem has developed a single framework for assets eligible as collateral so that all Eurosystem credit
operations are carried out in a harmonised manner by means of implementing this Guideline in all Member
States whose currency is the euro. The single framework for assets eligible as collateral covers marketable and
non-marketable assets that fulfil uniform eligibility criteria specified by the Eurosystem. Most eligible assets may
be used on a cross-border basis by means of the correspondent central banking model (CCBM) and, in the case of
marketable assets, through eligible links between eligible EEA securities settlement systems (SSSs) or eligible links
between eligible EEA SSSs in combination with the CCBM.
(21) Intraday credit is provided by the Eurosystem to even out mismatches in payment settlements. As laid down in
Article 12 of and Annex III to Guideline ECB/2012/27 (
1
), the collateral for the provision of intraday credit is
required to comply with the same criteria that assets eligible as collateral must fulfil under Part Four.
(22) All eligible assets for Eurosystem credit operations need to be subject to specific risk control measures in order to
protect the Eurosystem against financial losses in circumstances where its collateral has to be realised due to an
event of default of a counterparty. Eligible assets are required to meet the Eurosystem's credit quality
requirements specified in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF) rules.
(23) The ECB imposes sanctions on institutions which do not comply with obligations arising from ECB regulations
and decisions relating to the application of minimum reserves in accordance with Council Regulation (EC)
No 2532/98 (
2
), European Central Bank Regulation (EC) No 2157/1999 (ECB/1999/4) (
3
), Regulation (EC)
No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9). In the event of a serious infringement of the
minimum reserve requirements, the Eurosystem may also suspend counterparties' participation in open market
operations.
(24) In accordance with the provisions of the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the relevant NCB or
by the ECB, if counterparties fail to comply with their obligations under the contractual or regulatory
arrangements applied by the NCBs or by the ECB, as set out in this Guideline, the Eurosystem can impose
financial penalties or suspend counterparties' participation in open market operations or standing facilities.
(25) In accordance with the provisions in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the relevant NCB or
by the ECB, the Eurosystem may also suspend, limit or exclude counterparties' access to open market operations
or standing facilities on the grounds of prudence or if there is an event of default of a counterparty. On the
grounds of prudence, the Eurosystem may also reject, limit the use of or apply supplementary haircuts to assets
mobilised by specific counterparties as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.
(26) All contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the NCBs with their counterparties should contain
minimum common features aimed at ensuring the application of the single monetary policy under terms and
conditions which are not materially different among Member States whose currency is the euro,

SUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS
Article 1
Subject matter and scope
1. This Guideline sets out the uniform rules for the implementation of the single monetary policy by the Eurosystem
throughout the Member States whose currency is the euro.
2. The Eurosystem shall take all the appropriate measures to implement Eurosystem monetary policy operations in
accordance with the principles, tools, instruments, requirements, criteria and procedures laid down in this Guideline.
3. The legal relationship between the Eurosystem and its counterparties shall be established in appropriate
contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the relevant NCB, in which the provisions of this Guideline are
implemented accordingly.
4. The ECB's Governing Council may, at any time, change the tools, instruments, requirements, criteria and
procedures for the implementation of Eurosystem monetary policy operations.
5. The Eurosystem reserves the right to request and obtain any relevant information from counterparties that is
needed to carry out its tasks and achieve its objectives in relation to monetary policy operations. This right is without
prejudice to any other existing specific rights of the Eurosystem to request information relating to monetary policy
operations.
Article 2
Definitions
For the purposes of this Guideline, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) ‘actual/360 day-count convention’ means the convention applied in Eurosystem monetary policy operations
which determines the actual number of calendar days included in the calculation of interest by using a 360-day
year as the basis;
(2) ‘agency’ means entities that the Eurosystem has classified as agencies. The list of entities classified as agencies is
published on the ECB's website;
L 91/8 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
(3) ‘asset-backed securities’ (ABSs) means debt instruments that are backed by a pool of ring fenced financial assets
(fixed or revolving), that convert into cash within a finite time period. In addition, rights or other assets may exist
that ensure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the holders of the security. Generally, asset-backed
securities are issued by a specially created investment vehicle which has acquired the pool of financial assets from
the originator or seller. In this regard, payments on the asset-backed securities depend primarily on the cash flows
generated by the assets in the underlying pool and other rights designed to assure timely payment, such as
liquidity facilities, guarantees or other features generally known as credit enhancements;
(4) ‘bilateral procedure’ means a procedure whereby the NCBs or, in exceptional circumstances the ECB, conduct finetuning
operations or outright transactions, directly with one or more counterparties, or through stock exchanges
or market agents, without making use of tender procedures;

involve the physical movement of paper documents or certificates, e.g. the electronic transfer of securities;
(6) ‘business day’ means: (a) in relation to an obligation to make a payment, any day on which TARGET2 is
operational to effect such a payment; or (b) in relation to an obligation to deliver assets, any day on which the
SSS through which delivery is to be made is open for business in the place where delivery of the relevant
securities is to be effected;
(7) ‘central securities depository’ (CSD) means an entity that: (a) enables securities transactions to be processed and
settled by book entry; (b) provides custodial services (e.g. the administration of corporate actions and
redemptions); (c) plays an active role in ensuring the integrity of securities issues. Securities can be held in a
physical, but immobilised, form or in a dematerialised form (i.e. they exist only as electronic records);
(8) ‘collateralised loan’ means an arrangement between an NCB and a counterparty whereby liquidity is provided to a
counterparty by way of a loan that is secured by an enforceable security interest granted by that counterparty to
the NCB in the form of e.g. a pledge, assignment or charge granted over assets;
(9) ‘collection of fixed-term deposits’ means an instrument used in conducting open market operations, whereby the
Eurosystem invites counterparties to place fixed-term deposits on accounts with their home NCBs in order to
absorb liquidity from the market;

by national law to supervise institutions as part of the supervisory system in the relevant Member State;

(b) are conducted regularly each month in accordance with the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender
operations, subject to the exception laid down in paragraph 4;
(c) normally have a maturity of three months in accordance with the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular
tender operations, subject to the exceptions laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4;
(d) are executed in a decentralised manner by the NCBs;
(e) are executed by means of standard tender procedures;
(f) are subject to the eligibility criteria specified in Article 55 which must be fulfilled by all counterparties submitting

3. The maturity of LTROs may differ on the grounds of varying bank holidays in Member States whose currency is
the euro.
4. The Eurosystem may conduct — on a non-regular basis — LTROs with a maturity other than three months. Such
operations are not specified in the indicative calendar for the Eurosystem's regular tender operations.
5. LTROs with a maturity of more than three months that are conducted on a non-regular basis, as referred to in
paragraph 4, may have an early repayment clause. Such an early repayment clause may represent either an option or a
mandatory obligation for counterparties under which they repay all or part of the amounts they were allotted in a given
operation. Mandatory early repayment clauses shall be based on explicit and predefined conditions. The dates on which
the early repayments become effective shall be announced by the Eurosystem at the time of the announcement of the
operations. The Eurosystem may decide in exceptional circumstances to suspend early repayments on specific dates on
the grounds of, inter alia, bank holidays in Member States whose currency is the euro.
6. LTROs are executed by means of variable rate tender procedures, unless it is decided by the Eurosystem to execute
them by means of a fixed-rate tender procedure. In such a case, the rate applicable to fixed-rate tender procedures may
be indexed to an underlying reference rate (e.g. average MRO rate) over the life of the operation, with or without a
spread.

euro.
4. The NCBs shall only grant access to the standing facilities in accordance with the ECB's objectives and general
monetary policy considerations.
5. The ECB may adapt the conditions of the standing facilities or suspend them at any time.
6. The ECB's Governing Council shall decide on the interest rates for the standing facilities on a regular basis. The
revised interest rates shall become effective from the beginning of the new reserve maintenance period, as defined in
Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9). The ECB publishes a calendar of the reserve maintenance
periods at least three months before the start of each calendar year.
7. Notwithstanding paragraph 6, the ECB's Governing Council may change the interest rate for the standing facilities
at any point in time. Such decision shall become effective at the earliest from the following Eurosystem business day.
CHAPTER 1

where the transaction can be settled, notably in TARGET2, may access the marginal lending facility.
2. Access to the marginal lending facility shall be granted only on days when TARGET2 is operational. On days when
the SSSs are not operational, access to the marginal lending facility shall be granted on the basis of eligible assets which
have already been pre-deposited with the NCBs.
L 91/24 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
3. If an NCB or any of its branches are not open for the purpose of conducting monetary policy operations on
certain Eurosystem business days due to national or regional bank holidays, the home NCB shall inform its counterparties
in advance of the arrangements to be made for access to the marginal lending facility on that bank holiday.
4. Access to the marginal lending facility can be granted either based on a specific request of the counterparty or
automatically, as specified in paragraph 5 and 6 respectively.
5. A counterparty may send a request to its home NCB for access to the marginal lending facility. Provided that the
request is received by the home NCB at the latest 15 minutes following the TARGET2 closing time, the NCB shall
process the request on the same day in TARGET2. The deadline for requesting access to the marginal lending facility
shall be postponed by an additional 15 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve maintenance period.
The request for access to the marginal lending facility shall specify the amount of credit required. The counterparty shall
deliver sufficient eligible assets as collateral for the transaction, unless such assets have already been pre-deposited by the
counterparty with the home NCB pursuant to Article 18(4).
6. At the end of each business day, a negative balance on a counterparty's settlement account with its home NCB
after finalisation of the end-of-day control procedures shall automatically be considered as a request for recourse to the
marginal lending facility. In order to meet the requirement in Article 18(4), counterparties shall have pre-deposited
sufficient eligible assets as collateral for the transaction with the home NCB prior to such an automatic request arising.
Failure to comply with this access condition shall be subject to sanctions in accordance with Articles 154 to 157.
Article 20
Maturity and interest rate of the marginal lending facility
1. The maturity of credit extended under the marginal lending facility shall be overnight. For counterparties participating
directly in TARGET2, the credit shall be repaid on the next day on which: (a) TARGET2; and (b) the relevant SSSs
are operational, at the time at which those systems open.
2. The interest rate remunerating the marginal lending facility shall be announced in advance by the Eurosystem and
shall be calculated as a simple interest rate based on the actual/360 day-count convention. The interest rate applied to
the marginal lending facility is referred to as the marginal lending facility rate.

where the transaction can be settled, notably in TARGET2, may access the deposit facility. Access to the deposit facility
shall be granted only on days when TARGET2 is operational.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/25 
2. To be granted access to the deposit facility, the counterparty shall send a request to its home NCB. Provided that
the request is received by the home NCB at the latest 15 minutes following the TARGET2 closing time, the home NCB
shall process the request on the same day in TARGET2. The deadline for requesting access to the deposit facility shall be
postponed by an additional 15 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve maintenance period. The
request shall specify the amount to be deposited under the facility.
3. Due to the existence of different account structures across the NCBs, the NCBs, subject to the ECB's prior approval,
may apply access conditions which are different from those referred to in this Article. The NCBs shall provide
information to the counterparties on any such deviations from the access conditions described in this Article.
Article 23
Maturity and interest rate of the deposit facility
1. The maturity of deposits under the deposit facility shall be overnight. For counterparties participating directly in
TARGET2, deposits held under the deposit facility shall mature on the next day on which TARGET2 is operational, at
the time at which this system opens.

3. The Eurosystem may conduct either fixed-rate or variable rate tender procedures.
Article 26
Standard tender procedures
1. The Eurosystem shall use standard tender procedures for the execution of: (a) MROs; (b) LTROs; (c) specific
structural operations, i.e. structural reverse operations and the issuance of ECB debt certificates.
2. The Eurosystem may also use standard tender procedures to conduct fine-tuning operations and structural
operations executed by means of outright transactions in the light of specific monetary policy considerations or in order
to react to market conditions.
3. For standard tender procedures, as a rule: (a) a maximum of 24 hours shall elapse from the announcement of the
tender procedure to the certification of the allotment result; and (b) the time between the submission deadline and the
announcement of the allotment result is approximately two hours.
4. The ECB may decide to adjust the time frame in individual operations, if deemed appropriate.
Article 27
Quick tender procedures

Article 29
Execution of tender procedures for fine-tuning and structural operations without a tender operation calendar
1. Fine-tuning operations are not executed according to any pre-specified calendar. The ECB may decide to conduct
fine-tuning operations on any Eurosystem business day. Only NCBs in relation to which the trade day, the settlement day
and the reimbursement day are NCB business days participate in such operations.
2. Structural operations executed by means of standard tender procedures are not performed according to any prespecified
calendar. They are normally conducted and settled on days which are NCB business days in all Member States

ECB's website. In quick tender procedures that are publicly announced in advance, the NCB may contact the selected
counterparties directly if deemed necessary. In quick tender procedures that are not announced publicly in advance, the
selected counterparties shall be contacted directly by the NCBs.
3. The tender announcement represents an invitation to counterparties to submit bids, which are legally binding. The
announcement does not represent an offer by the ECB or the NCBs.
4. The information to be included in the public announcement of a tender procedure is laid down in Annex II.
5. The ECB may take any action it deems appropriate to correct any error in the announcement of tender procedures,
including cancelling or interrupting a tender procedure under execution.
Subsection 2
Preparation and submission of bids by counterparties
Article 31
Form and place of submission of bids
1. The bids must be submitted to a counterparty's home NCB. The bids of an institution may only be submitted to

with the NCBs.
2. In fixed-rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures, the counterparties shall state the amount of currency kept
fixed that they intend to sell and buy back, or buy and sell back, at that rate.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/29 
3. In variable rate tender procedures, counterparties may submit bids for up to 10 different interest rates, prices or
swap points. Under exceptional circumstances, the Eurosystem may impose a limit on the number of bids that may be
submitted by each counterparty. In each bid, counterparties shall state the amount that they are willing to transact and
the relevant interest rate or price or swap point. A bid for an interest rate or swap point shall be expressed as multiples
of 0,01 percentage points. A bid for a price shall be expressed as multiples of 0,001 percentage points.
4. For variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures, the counterparties shall state the amount of the
currency to be kept fixed and the swap point quotation at which they intend to enter into the operation.
5. For variable rate foreign exchange swap tender procedures, the swap points shall be quoted in accordance with
standard market conventions and bids shall be expressed as multiples of 0,01 swap points.
6. With regard to the issuance of ECB debt certificates, the ECB may decide that bids shall be expressed in the form
of a price rather than an interest rate. In such cases, prices shall be quoted as a percentage of the nominal amount, with
three decimal places.
Article 33
Minimum and maximum bid amounts
1. For MROs, the minimum bid amount shall be EUR 1 000 000. Bids exceeding this amount shall be expressed as
multiples of EUR 100 000. The minimum bid amount shall apply to each individual interest rate level.

and settled on days which are NCB business days in all Member States whose currency is the euro.
CHAPTER 2
Settlement procedures for Eurosystem monetary policy operations
Article 49
Overview of settlement procedures
1. Payment orders relating to the participation in open market operations or use of the standing facilities shall be
settled on the counterparties' accounts with an NCB or on the accounts of a settlement bank participating in TARGET2.
2. Payment orders relating to the participation in open market liquidity-providing operations or use of the marginal

(a) pre-deposit the eligible assets at an NCB; or
L 91/34 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
(b) settle the eligible assets with an NCB on a delivery-versus-payment basis.
Article 50
Settlement of open market operations
1. The Eurosystem shall endeavour to settle transactions related to its open market operations at the same time in all
Member States whose currency is the euro with all counterparties that have provided sufficient eligible assets as
collateral. However, owing to operational constraints and technical features (e.g. of SSSs), the timing within the day of
the settlement of open market operations may differ across the Member States whose currency is the euro.
2. The indicative settlement dates are summarised in Table 8.

PART THREE
ELIGIBLE COUNTERPARTIES
Article 55
Eligibility criteria for participation in Eurosystem monetary policy operations
With regard to Eurosystem monetary policy operations, subject to Article 57, the Eurosystem shall only allow participation
by institutions that fulfil the criteria laid down in this Article.
(a) They shall be subject to the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system pursuant to Article 19.1 of the Statute of the
ESCB and shall not have been granted an exemption from their obligations under the Eurosystem's minimum reserve
system pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9).
(b) They must be financially sound.
(c) They shall be one of the following:
(i) subject to at least one form of harmonised Union/EEA supervision by competent authorities in accordance with
Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(ii) publicly-owned credit institutions, within the meaning of Article 123(2) of the Treaty, subject to supervision of
a standard comparable to supervision by competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation
(EU) No 575/2013;
(iii) institutions subject to non-harmonised supervision by competent authorities of a standard comparable to
harmonised Union/EEA supervision by competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013, e.g. branches established in Member States whose currency is the euro of institutions
incorporated outside the EEA;
(d) They shall fulfil any operational requirements specified in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the
home NCB or ECB in respect of the specific instrument or operation.
Article 56
Access to open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures and to standing facilities
1. Institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 shall have access to any of the following Eurosystem
monetary policy operations:
(a) standing facilities;
(b) open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures.
L 91/36 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
2. Access to the standing facilities or open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures shall
only be granted to institutions fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 through their home NCB.
3. Where an institution fulfilling the eligibility criteria under Article 55 has establishments, e.g. head office or
branches, in more than one Member State whose currency is the euro, each establishment fulfilling the eligibility criteria
under Article 55 may access the standing facilities or the open market operations executed by means of standard tender
procedures through its home NCB.
4. Bids for open market operations executed by means of standard tender procedures and for recourse to the standing
facilities shall be submitted by only one establishment in each Member State whose currency is the euro, i.e. either by
the head office or by a designated branch.
Article 57
Selection of counterparties for access to open market operations executed by means of quick tender
procedures or bilateral procedures
1. For open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, counterparties
shall be selected in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 4.
2. For structural operations conducted by means of outright transactions that are executed by means of bilateral
procedures, there shall be no restriction on the range of counterparties. For structural operations conducted by means of
outright transactions, which are executed by means of quick tender procedures, the eligibility criteria laid down in
Article 57(3)(b) shall apply.
3. For fine-tuning operations that are executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, counterparties
shall be selected as follows:
(a) For fine-tuning operations that are conducted by means of foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes
and executed by means of quick tender or bilateral procedures, the range of counterparties shall be identical to the
range of entities that are selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations and are established in the
Member States whose currency is the euro. Counterparties for foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes
by means of quick tender or bilateral procedures do not need to fulfil the criteria laid down in Article 55. The
selection criteria for counterparties participating in Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations are based
on the principles of prudence and efficiency, as laid down in Annex V. The NCBs may apply limit-based systems in
order to control credit exposures vis-à-vis individual counterparties participating in foreign exchange swaps for
monetary policy purposes.
(b) For fine-tuning operations conducted by means of reverse transactions or through the collection of fixed-term
deposits and executed by means of quick tender procedures or bilateral procedures, each NCB shall select, for a
specific transaction, a set of counterparties from among the institutions that fulfil the eligibility criteria laid down in
Article 55 and are established in its Member State whose currency is the euro. The selection shall be primarily based
on the relevant institution's activity in the money market. Additional selection criteria may be applied by the NCB,
such as the efficiency of the trading desk and the bidding potential.
4. If the ECB's Governing Council, pursuant to Article 45(3), decides that the ECB shall conduct, by itself or by means
of one or more NCBs fine-tuning operations executed by means of bilateral procedures, the ECB shall select its counterparties
in accordance with a rotation scheme among the counterparties that are eligible to participate in quick tender
procedures and bilateral procedures.
5. Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 4, open market operations executed by means of quick tender procedures or
bilateral procedures may also be conducted with a broader range of counterparties than those indicated in paragraphs 2
to 4, if the ECB's Governing Council so decides.
PART FOUR
ELIGIBLE ASSETS
TITLE I
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Article 58
Eligible assets and accepted collateralisation techniques to be used for Eurosystem credit operations
1. The Eurosystem shall apply a single framework for eligible assets common to all Eurosystem credit operations as
laid down in this Guideline.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/37 
2. In order to participate in Eurosystem credit operations, counterparties shall provide the Eurosystem with assets
that are eligible as collateral for such operations. Given that Eurosystem credit operations include intraday credit,
collateral provided by counterparties in respect of intraday credit shall also comply with the eligibility criteria laid down
in this Guideline, as outlined in Guideline ECB/2012/27.
3. Counterparties shall provide eligible assets by:
(a) the transfer of ownership, which takes the legal form of a repurchase agreement; or
(b) the creation of a security interest, i.e. a pledge, assignment or a charge granted over the relevant assets, which takes
the legal form of a collateralised loan,
in either case pursuant to the national contractual or regulatory arrangements established and documented by the home
NCB.
4. Where counterparties provide eligible assets as collateral, the home NCB may require either earmarking or pooling
of eligible assets, depending on which type of collateral management system it uses.
5. No distinction shall be made between marketable and non-marketable assets with regard to the quality of the
assets and their eligibility for the various types of Eurosystem credit operations.
6. Without prejudice to the obligation in paragraph 2 that counterparties provide the Eurosystem with assets that are
eligible as collateral, the Eurosystem may, upon request, provide counterparties with advice regarding the eligibility of
marketable assets if they have already been issued or regarding the eligibility of non-marketable assets when they have
already been requested for submission. The Eurosystem shall not provide any advice in advance of these events.
Article 59
General aspects of the Eurosystem credit assessment framework for eligible assets
1. As one of the criteria for eligibility, assets shall meet the high credit standards specified in the Eurosystem credit
assessment framework (ECAF).
2. The ECAF shall lay down the procedures, rules and techniques to ensure that the Eurosystem's requirement for
high credit standards for eligible assets is maintained and that eligible assets comply with the credit quality requirements
defined by the Eurosystem.
3. For the purposes of the ECAF, the Eurosystem shall define credit quality requirements in the form of credit quality
steps by establishing threshold values for the probability of default (PD) over a one-year horizon, as follows.
(a) The Eurosystem considers, subject to regular review, a maximum probability of default over a one-year horizon of
0,10 % as equivalent to the credit quality requirement of credit quality step 2 and a maximum probability of default
over a one-year horizon of 0,40 % as equivalent to the credit quality requirement of credit quality step 3.
(b) All eligible assets for Eurosystem credit operations shall comply, as a minimum, with a credit quality requirement
corresponding to credit quality step 3. Additional credit quality requirements for specific assets shall be applied by
the Eurosystem in accordance with Titles II and III of Part Four.
4. The Eurosystem shall publish information on credit quality steps on the ECB website in the form of the
Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale, including the mapping of credit assessments, provided by the accepted external
credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) and third-party rating tools (RTs) providers, to credit quality steps.
5. In the assessment of the credit quality requirements, the Eurosystem takes into account credit assessment
information from credit assessment systems belonging to one of four sources in accordance with Title V of Part Four.
6. As part of its assessment of the credit standard of a specific asset, the Eurosystem may take into account institutional
criteria and features ensuring similar protection for the asset holder, such as guarantees. The Eurosystem reserves
the right to determine whether an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fulfils the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements
on the basis of any information that the Eurosystem may consider relevant for ensuring adequate risk protection of the
Eurosystem.
L 91/38 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
7. The ECAF follows the definition of ‘default’ laid down in Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
TITLE II
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND CREDIT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR MARKETABLE ASSETS
CHAPTER 1
Eligibility criteria for marketable assets
Article 60
Eligibility criteria relating to all types of marketable assets

the eligibility criteria laid down in Section 1, except in the case of certain specific types of marketable assets, as laid
down in Section 2.
Article 61
List of eligible marketable assets and reporting rules
1. The ECB shall publish an updated list of eligible marketable assets on its website, in accordance with
the methodologies indicated on its website and shall update it every weekday. Assets assessed in accordance with
Article 87(3) shall not be published on this list of eligible marketable assets.

General eligibility c riteria for marketable assets
Article 62
Principal amount of marketable assets
1. In order to be eligible, until their final redemption, debt instruments shall have:
(a) a fixed and unconditional principal amount; or
(b) an unconditional principal amount that is linked, on a flat basis, to only one euro area inflation index at a single
point in time, containing no other complex structures.
2. Debt instruments with a principal amount linked to only one euro area inflation index at a single point in time
shall also be permissible, given that the coupon structure is as defined in Article 63(1)(b)(i) fourth indent and linked to
the same euro area inflation index.
3. Assets with warrants or similar rights attached shall not be eligible.
Article 63
Acceptable coupon structures for marketable assets
1. In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall have either of the following coupon structures until final
redemption:

result in a negative cash flow; or
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/39 
(b) floating coupons that may not result in a negative cash flow and that have the following structure: coupon rate =
(reference rate * l) ± x, with f ≤ coupon rate ≤ c, where:
(i) the reference rate is only one of the following at a single point in time:
— a euro money market rate, e.g. EURIBOR, LIBOR or similar indices;
— a constant maturity swap rate e.g. CMS, EIISDA, EUSA;
— the yield of one or an index of several euro area government bonds that have a maturity of one year or less;
— a euro area inflation index; and
(ii) f (floor), c (ceiling), l (leveraging/deleveraging factor) and x (margin) are, if present, numbers that are either predefined
at issuance, or may change over time only according to a path pre-defined at issuance, where f and c are
greater than or equal to zero and l is greater than zero throughout the entire lifetime of the asset. For floating
coupons with an inflation index reference rate, l shall be equal to one.
2. Debt instruments with a floating coupon, as referred to in paragraph 1(b), shall be considered ineligible if at any
time following the application of the coupon rate formula, the coupon rate results in a negative value.
3. Any coupon structure that does not comply with paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not be eligible, including instances
where only part of the remuneration structure, such as a premium, is non-compliant.
4. For the purpose of this Article, if the coupon is either of a fixed multi-step type or of a floating multi-step type,
the assessment of the relevant coupon structure shall be based on the entire lifetime of the asset with both a forwardand
backward-looking perspective.
5. Acceptable coupon structures shall have no issuer optionalities, i.e. during the entire lifetime of the asset, based on
a forward- and backward-looking perspective, changes in the coupon structure that are contingent on an issuer's
decision shall not be acceptable.
Article 64
Non-subordination with respect to marketable assets
Eligible debt instruments shall not give rise to rights to the principal and/or the interest that are subordinated to the
rights of holders of other debt instruments of the same issuer.
Article 65

has been provided by an accepted ECAI system for the issue, issuer or guarantor, the place of issue must be within the
euro area.
3. International debt instruments issued through the ICSDs Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking Luxembourg
shall comply with the following criteria, as applicable.
(a) International debt instruments issued in global bearer form shall be issued in the form of new global notes (NGNs)
and shall be deposited with a common safekeeper which is an ICSD or a CSD that has been positively assessed
pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework. By way of derogation, this shall not apply to international
debt instruments issued in global bearer form issued in the form of classical global notes prior to 1 January 2007
and fungible tap issuances of such notes issued under the same ISIN irrespective of the date of the tap-issuance.
L 91/40 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015

2. If the CSD/SSS where the asset is issued and the CSD/SSS where the asset is held, are not identical, for the
purposes of eligibility, the two must be connected by an eligible link positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User
Assessment Framework in accordance with Article 150.
Article 68
Acceptable markets for marketable assets
1. In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be those which are admitted to trading on a regulated market as

), or admitted to trading on certain
acceptable non-regulated markets.
2. The ECB shall publish the list of acceptable non-regulated markets on its website and shall update it at least
once a year.
3. The assessment of non-regulated markets by the Eurosystem shall be based on the following principles of safety,
transparency and accessibility.
(a) Safety refers to certainty with regard to transactions, in particular certainty in relation to the validity and enforceability
of transactions.
(b) Transparency refers to unimpeded access to information on the market's rules of procedure and operation, the
financial features of the assets, the price formation mechanism, and the relevant prices and quantities, e.g. quotes,
interest rates, trading volumes, outstanding amounts.
(c) Accessibility refers to the ability of the Eurosystem to take part in and access the market. A market is considered
accessible if its rules of procedure and operation allow the Eurosystem to obtain information and conduct
transactions when needed for collateral management purposes.
4. The selection process for non-regulated markets shall be defined exclusively in terms of the performance of the
Eurosystem collateral management function and should not be regarded as an assessment by the Eurosystem of the
intrinsic quality of any market.
Article 69
Type of issuer or guarantor for marketable assets
1. In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be issued or guaranteed by central banks of Member States, public
sector entities, agencies, credit institutions, financial corporations other than credit institutions, non-financial
corporations, multilateral development banks or international organisations.
2. In addition to those banks and organisations identified in Article 117(2) and Article 118 of Regulation (EU)
No 575/2013, the Eurosystem may recognise any entity as a multilateral development bank or international
organisation for the purposes of this Guideline based upon an assessment relating to all of the following criteria:
(a) it is an organisation with a global or regional mandate, transcending national boundaries;

) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and
amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p. 349). 
(b) it is funded predominantly by contributions from national governments, or organisations or entities linked with
national governments;
(c) the mission of the entity is in line with the Union's policies.
Article 70
Place of establishment of the issuer or guarantor
1. In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall be issued by an issuer established in the EEA or in a non-EEA
G10 country, subject to the exceptions in paragraphs 3 to 6.
2. In order to be eligible, guarantors of debt instruments shall be established in the EEA, unless a guarantee is not
needed to establish the credit quality requirements for specific debt instruments, subject to the exceptions laid down in
paragraphs 3 and 4. The possibility to use an ECAI guarantor rating to establish the relevant credit quality requirements
for specific debt instruments is laid down in Article 84.
3. For debt instruments issued or guaranteed by non-financial corporations for which no credit assessment from an
accepted ECAI system exists for the issue, the issuer or the guarantor, the issuer or guarantor shall be established in a
Member State whose currency is the euro.
4. For debt instruments issued or guaranteed by multilateral development banks or international organisations, the
criterion in respect of place of establishment shall not apply and they shall be eligible irrespective of their place of
establishment.
5. For asset-backed securities, the issuer must be established in the EEA in accordance with Article 74.
6. Debt instruments issued by issuers established in non-EEA G10 countries shall only be considered eligible if the
Eurosystem has ascertained to its satisfaction that its rights would be protected in an appropriate manner under the laws
of the relevant non-EEA G10 country. For this purpose, a legal assessment shall be submitted to the relevant NCB, in a
form and substance acceptable to the Eurosystem, before the relevant debt instruments may be considered eligible.
Article 71
Credit quality requirements for marketable assets
In order to be eligible, debt instruments shall meet the credit quality requirements specified in Chapter 2, except where
otherwise stated.
Section 2

Subsection 1
Specific eligibility c riteria for asset-backed securities
Article 72
Eligibility criteria for asset-backed securities
In order to be eligible for Eurosystem credit operations, asset-backed securities shall comply with the general eligibility
criteria relating to all types of marketable assets laid down in Section 1, with the exception of the requirements laid
down in Article 62 relating to the principal amount, and in addition, the specific eligibility criteria laid down in this
subsection.
Article 73
Homogeneity and composition of the cash-flow generating assets
1. In order for ABSs to be eligible, all cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs shall be homogenous, i.e. it shall
be possible to report them according to one of the existing loan-level templates, which shall be one of the following:
(a) residential mortgages;
L 91/42 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
(b) commercial real estate mortgages;
(c) loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);
(d) auto loans;
(e) consumer finance loans;
(f) leasing receivables;
(g) credit card receivables.
2. The Eurosystem may consider an ABS not to be homogenous upon assessment of the data submitted by a
counterparty.
3. ABSs shall not contain any cash-flow generating assets originated directly by the SPV issuing the ABSs.
4. The cash-flow generating assets shall not consist, in whole or in part, actually or potentially, of tranches of other
ABSs. This criterion shall not exclude ABSs where the issuance structure includes two SPVs and the ‘true sale’ criterion is
met in respect of those SPVs so that the debt instruments issued by the second SPV are directly or indirectly backed by
the original pool of assets and all cash flows from the cash-flow generating assets are transferred from the first to the
second SPV.
5. The cash-flow generating assets shall not consist, in whole or in part, actually or potentially, of credit-linked notes,
swaps or other derivatives instruments, synthetic securities or similar claims. This restriction shall not encompass swaps
used in ABS transactions strictly for hedging purposes.
6. Without prejudice to the eligibility criteria of this subsection, the cash-flow generating assets backing commercial
mortgage-backed securities shall not contain loans which are at any time structured, syndicated or leveraged. For the
purposes of this criterion, ‘structured loan’ means a structure involving subordinated tranches, ‘syndicated loan’ means a
loan provided by a group of lenders in a lending syndicate and ‘leveraged loan’ means a loan provided to a company
that already has a considerable degree of indebtedness, such as buy-out or take-over-financing, where the loan is used
for the acquisition of the equity of a company which is also the obligor of the loan.
7. If the cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs comprise leasing receivables with residual value leases, those
ABSs that were on the list of eligible assets on 1 May 2015 shall maintain their eligibility until 31 August 2015.
Article 74
Geographical restrictions concerning asset-backed securities and cash-flow generating assets
1. The issuer of ABSs shall be an SPV established in the EEA.
2. The cash-flow generating assets shall be originated by an originator incorporated in the EEA and sold to the SPV
by the originator or by an intermediary incorporated in the EEA.
3. For the purpose of paragraph 2, a mortgage trustee or receivables trustee shall be considered to be an
intermediary. ABSs on the list of eligible marketable assets as on 1 May 2015 that do not comply with paragraph 2 as
regards the place of incorporation of a mortgage trustee or receivables trustee shall remain eligible until 1 May 2016
provided all other applicable eligibility criteria are met.
4. The obligors and the creditors of the cash-flow generating assets shall be incorporated, or, if they are natural
persons, shall be resident in the EEA. Any related security shall be located in the EEA and the law governing the
cash-flow generating assets shall be the law of an EEA country.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/43 
Article 75
Acquisition of cash-flow generating assets by the SPV
1. The acquisition of the cash-flow generating assets by the SPV shall be governed by the law of a Member State.
2. The cash-flow generating assets shall have been acquired by the SPV from the originator or from an intermediary
as laid down in Article 74(2) in a manner which the Eurosystem considers to be a ‘true sale’ that is enforceable against
any third party, and which is beyond the reach of the originator and its creditors or the intermediary and its creditors,
including in the event of the originator's or the intermediary's insolvency.
Article 76
Assessment of clawback rules for asset-backed securities
1. ABSs shall only be considered eligible if the Eurosystem has ascertained that its rights would be protected in an
appropriate manner against clawback rules considered relevant by the Eurosystem under the law of the relevant EEA
country. For this purpose, before the ABSs may be considered eligible, the Eurosystem may require:
(a) an independent legal assessment in a form and substance acceptable to the Eurosystem that sets out the applicable
clawback rules in the relevant country; and/or
(b) other documents, such as a solvency certificate from the transferor for the suspect period, which is a certain period
of time during which the sale of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs may be invalidated by a liquidator.
2. Clawback rules, which the Eurosystem considers to be severe and therefore not acceptable, shall include:
(a) rules under which the sale of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs can be invalidated by a liquidator solely
on the basis that the sale was concluded within the suspect period, as referred to in paragraph 1(b), before the
declaration of insolvency of the seller; or
(b) rules where such invalidation can only be prevented by the transferee if they can prove that they were not aware of
the insolvency of the seller at the time of the sale.
For the purposes of this criterion, the seller may be the originator or intermediary, as applicable.
Article 77
Non-subordination of tranches for asset-backed securities
1. Only tranches or sub-tranches of ABSs that are not subordinated to other tranches of the same issue over the
lifetime of the ABS shall be considered eligible.
2. A tranche or sub-tranche shall be considered to be non-subordinated to other tranches or sub-tranches of the same
issue if, in accordance with the post-enforcement priority of payments, and if applicable, the post-acceleration priority of
payments as set out in the prospectus, no other tranche or sub-tranche shall be given priority over that tranche or subtranche
in respect of receiving payment, i.e. principal and interest, and thereby such tranche or sub-tranche shall be last
in incurring losses among the different tranches or sub-tranches.
Article 78
Availability of loan level data for asset-backed securities
1. Comprehensive and standardised loan-level data on the pool of cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs shall
be made available in accordance with the procedures set out in Annex VIII, which includes the information on the
required data quality score. In its eligibility assessment, the Eurosystem takes account of: (a) any failure to deliver data;
and (b) how frequently individual loan-level data fields are found not to contain meaningful data.
L 91/44 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
2. Notwithstanding the required scoring values set out in Annex VIII in respect of loan-level data, the Eurosystem
may accept as collateral asset-backed securities with a score lower than the required scoring value (A1) after completion
of the relevant transitional period applicable in accordance with Annex VIII, on a case-by-case basis and subject to the
provision of adequate explanations for the failure to achieve the required score. For each adequate explanation, the
Eurosystem shall specify a maximum tolerance level and a tolerance horizon, as further specified on the ECB's website.
The tolerance horizon shall indicate the time period within which the data quality for the ABSs must improve.
Article 79
Data requests for asset-backed securities
The Eurosystem shall reserve the right to request from any third party it considers relevant, including but not restricted
to, the issuer, the originator and/or the arranger, any clarification and/or legal confirmation that it considers necessary to
assess the eligibility of ABSs and with regard to the provision of loan-level data. If a third party fails to comply with a
particular request, the Eurosystem may decide not to accept the ABSs as collateral or may decide to suspend the
eligibility of such collateral.
Subsection 2
Specific eligibility c riteria for c overed bonds backed by asset-backed securities
Article 80
Eligibility criteria for covered bonds backed by asset-backed securities
1. In the case of covered bonds backed by asset-backed securities, the cover pool of the covered bond shall only
contain ABSs that comply with all of the following.
(a) The cash-flow generating assets backing the ABSs meet the criteria laid down in Article 129(1)(d) to (f) of
Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 in respect of ABSs backing covered bonds.
(b) The cash-flow generating assets were originated by an entity closely linked to the issuer of the covered bonds, as
described in Article 138.
(c) They are used as a technical tool to transfer mortgages or guaranteed real estate loans from the originating entity
into the cover pool of the respective covered bond.
2. Subject to paragraph 4, the NCBs shall use the following measures to verify that the cover pool of covered bonds
backed by ABSs does not contain ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1.
(a) On a quarterly basis, the NCBs shall request a self-certification and undertaking of the issuer confirming that the
cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs does not contain ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1. The
NCB's request shall specify that the self-certification must be signed by the issuer's Chief Executive Officer (CEO),
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or a manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on their behalf.
(b) On an annual basis, NCBs shall request an ex post confirmation by external auditors or cover pool monitors from
the issuer, confirming that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by ABSs does not contain ABSs that do not
comply with paragraph 1 for the monitoring period.
3. If the issuer fails to comply with a particular request or if the Eurosystem deems the content of a confirmation
incorrect or insufficient to the extent that it is not possible to verify that the cover pool of covered bonds backed by
ABSs comply with criteria in paragraph 1, the Eurosystem shall decide not to accept the covered bonds as eligible
collateral or to suspend their eligibility.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/45 
4. Where the applicable legislation or prospectus exclude the inclusion of ABSs that do not comply with paragraph 1
as cover pool assets, no verification pursuant to paragraph 2 shall be required.
5. For the purposes of paragraph 1(b), the close links shall be determined at the time that the senior units of the
asset-backed securities are transferred into the cover pool of the covered bond.
Subsection 3
Specific eligibility c riteria for debt certificates issued by the Eurosystem
Article 81
Eligibility criteria for debt certificates issued by the Eurosystem
1. Debt certificates issued by the ECB and debt certificates issued by the NCBs prior to the date of adoption of the
euro in their respective Member State whose currency is the euro shall be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit
operations.
2. Debt certificates issued by the Eurosystem shall not be subject to the criteria laid down in this Chapter.
CHAPTER 2
Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for marketable assets
Article 82
Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for marketable assets
1. Further to the general rules set out in Article 59 and to the specific rules set out in Article 84, marketable assets
shall comply with the following credit quality requirements in order to be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit
operations:
(a) With the exception of ABSs, all marketable assets shall have a credit assessment provided by at least one accepted
ECAI system, expressed in the form of a public credit rating, in compliance with, as a minimum, credit quality
step 3 in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.
(b) ABSs shall have credit assessments that are provided by at least two different accepted ECAI systems expressed in the
form of two public credit ratings, one provided by each of these ECAI systems, in compliance with, as a minimum,
credit quality step 2 in the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.
2. The Eurosystem may request any clarification that it considers necessary as regards the public credit rating referred
to in paragraph 1.
Article 83
Types of ECAI credit assessments used for credit quality assessments of marketable assets
The following types of ECAI credit assessments from accepted ECAIs shall be used in determining compliance with the
credit quality requirements applicable to marketable assets.
(a) An ECAI issue rating: this rating refers to an ECAI credit assessment assigned to either an issue or, in the absence of
an issue rating from the same ECAI, the programme or issuance series under which an asset is issued. An ECAI
assessment for a programme or issuance series shall only be relevant if it applies to the particular asset in question
and a different issue rating from the same ECAI does not exist. For ECAI issue ratings, the Eurosystem shall make
no distinction in respect of the original maturity of the asset. Any ECAI rating assigned to the issue or programme
or issuance series shall be acceptable.
(b) An ECAI issuer rating: this rating refers to an ECAI credit assessment assigned to an issuer. For ECAI issuer ratings,
the Eurosystem shall make a distinction in respect of the original maturity of the asset as regards the acceptable
ECAI credit assessment. The distinction shall be made between:
(i) short-term assets, i.e. those assets with an original maturity of up to and including 390 days; and
(ii) long-term assets, i.e. those assets with an original maturity of more than 390 days. For short-term assets, ECAI
short-term and long-term issuer ratings shall be acceptable. For long-term assets, only ECAI long-term issuer
ratings shall be acceptable.
L 91/46 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
(c) An ECAI guarantor rating: this rating refers to an ECAI credit assessment assigned to a guarantor, if the guarantee
meets the requirements of Title IV. For ECAI guarantor ratings, the Eurosystem shall make no distinction in respect
of the original maturity of the asset. Only ECAI long-term guarantor ratings shall be acceptable.
Article 84
Priority of ECAI credit assessments in respect of marketable assets
For marketable assets, ECAI credit assessments which determine the compliance of the asset with the credit quality
requirements shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem in accordance with the following rules:
(a) For marketable assets other than marketable assets issued by central governments, regional governments, local
governments, agencies, multilateral development banks or international organisations and ABSs, the following rules
shall apply.
(i) The Eurosystem shall consider ECAI issue ratings in priority to ECAI issuer or ECAI guarantor ratings. Without
prejudice to the application of this priority rule, in accordance with Article 82(1)(a), at least one ECAI credit
assessment must comply with the Eurosystem's applicable credit quality requirements.
(ii) If multiple ECAI issue ratings are available for the same issue, then the first-best of those ECAI issue ratings
shall be taken into account by the Eurosystem. If the first-best ECAI issue rating does not comply with the
Eurosystem's credit quality threshold for marketable assets, the asset shall not be eligible, even if a guarantee
that is acceptable under Title IV exists.
(iii) In the absence of any ECAI issue rating, an ECAI issuer or ECAI guarantor rating may be considered by the
Eurosystem. If multiple ECAI issuer and/or ECAI guarantor ratings are available for the same issue, then the
first-best of those ratings shall be taken account by the Eurosystem.
(b) For marketable assets issued by central governments, regional governments, local governments, agencies, multilateral
development banks or international organisations, the following rules shall apply.
(i) In accordance with Article 82(1)(a), at least one ECAI credit assessment must comply with the Eurosystem's
applicable credit quality requirements. The Eurosystem shall only consider ECAI issuer or ECAI guarantor
ratings.
(ii) If multiple ECAI issuer and ECAI guarantor ratings are available, the first-best of those ratings shall be taken
into account by the Eurosystem.
(iii) Covered bonds issued by agencies shall not be assessed in accordance with the rules in this point and shall
instead be assessed in accordance with point (a).
(c) For ABSs, the following rules shall apply.
(i) In accordance with Article 82(1)(b), at least two ECAI credit assessments shall comply with the Eurosystem's
applicable credit quality requirements. The Eurosystem shall only consider ECAI issue ratings.
(ii) If more than two ECAI issue ratings are available, the first- and second-best of such ECAI issue ratings shall be
taken into account by the Eurosystem.
Article 85
Multi-issuer securities
For marketable assets with more than one issuer (multi-issuer securities), the applicable ECAI issuer rating shall be
determined on the basis of each issuer's potential liability as follows:
(a) If each issuer is jointly and severally liable for the obligations of all other issuers under the issue or, if applicable, for
the programme, or issuance series, the ECAI issuer rating to be considered shall be the highest rating among the
first-best ECAI issuer ratings of all the relevant issuers; or
(b) If any issuer is not jointly and severally liable for the obligations of all other issuers under the issue or, if applicable,
for the programme, or issuance series, the ECAI issuer rating to be considered shall be the lowest rating among the
first-best ECAI issuer ratings of all the relevant issuers.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/47 
Article 86
Non-euro ratings
For the purpose of ECAI issuer ratings, a foreign currency rating shall be acceptable. If the asset is denominated in the
domestic currency of the issuer, the local currency rating shall also be acceptable.
Article 87
Credit quality assessment criteria for marketable assets in the absence of a credit assessment provided by an
accepted ECAI
1. In the absence of an appropriate credit assessment provided by an accepted ECAI for the issue, issuer or guarantor,
as would be applicable pursuant to Article 84(a) or (b), an implicit credit assessment of marketable assets (with the
exception of ABSs) shall be derived by the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules laid down in paragraphs 2 and 3.
This implicit credit assessment is required to comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements.
2. If the debt instruments are issued or guaranteed by a regional government or a local authority or a ‘public sector
entity’ as defined in Article 4(8) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (hereinafter a ‘CRR public sector entity’) established in
a Member State whose currency is the euro, the credit assessment shall be performed by the Eurosystem in accordance
with the following rules.
(a) If the issuers or guarantors are regional governments, local authorities or CRR public sector entities, which
according to competent authorities are treated for capital requirements purposes pursuant to Articles 115(2), 116(1)
and 116(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 equally to the central government in whose jurisdiction they are
established, the debt instruments issued or guaranteed by these entities shall be allocated the credit quality step
corresponding to the best credit rating provided by an accepted ECAI to the central government in whose
jurisdiction these entities are established.
(b) If the issuers or guarantors are regional governments, local authorities and CRR public sector entities, which
according to competent authorities are treated for capital requirements purposes pursuant to Articles 115(1)
and 116(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 equally to credit institutions, the debt instruments issued or guaranteed
by these entities shall be allocated the credit step corresponding to one credit quality step below the best credit
rating provided by an accepted ECAI in relation to the central government in which jurisdiction these entities are
established.
(c) If the issuers or guarantors are CRR public sector entities that are not referred to in points (a) and (b), no implicit
credit assessment is derived and they shall be treated equally to private sector entities.
3. If the debt instruments are issued or guaranteed by non-financial corporations established in a Member State
whose currency is the euro, the credit quality assessment shall be performed by the Eurosystem based on the credit
quality assessment rules applicable to the credit quality assessment of credit claims in Chapter 2 of Title III. Assets in
relation to which the credit quality is assessed in accordance with the rules contained in this paragraph shall not be
included in the public list of eligible marketable assets.

Article 88
Additional credit quality requirements for asset-backed securities
1. For ABSs, the credit quality assessment shall be based on a public issue rating that is explained in a publicly
available credit rating report, i.e. a new issue report. The publicly available credit rating report shall include, inter alia, a
comprehensive analysis of structural and legal aspects, a detailed collateral pool assessment, an analysis of the
transaction participants, as well as an analysis of any other relevant details of a transaction.
2. Further to the requirement in paragraph 1, regular surveillance reports published by the accepted ECAIs are
required for asset-backed securities. The publication of these reports shall take place no later than four weeks after the
coupon payment date of the ABSs. The reference date of these reports shall be the most recent coupon payment date
except for ABSs paying the coupon on a monthly basis, in which case the surveillance report shall be published at least
quarterly. The surveillance reports shall contain, as a minimum, the key transaction data, e.g. composition of the
collateral pool, transaction participants, capital structure, as well as performance data.
TITLE III
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND CREDIT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS
CHAPTER 1
Eligibility criteria for non-marketable assets
Section 1
Eligibility c riteria for credit claims
Article 89
Eligible type of asset
1. The eligible type of asset shall be a credit claim that is a debt obligation of a debtor vis-à-vis a counterparty.
2. Types of credit claims that have a ‘reducing balance’, i.e. where the principal and interest are paid off according to
a pre-agreed schedule, as well as drawn credit lines, shall be eligible types of credit claim.
3. Current account overdrafts, letters of credit and undrawn credit lines, e.g. undrawn facilities of revolving credit
claims, which authorise the use of credit but are not credit claims per se, shall not be eligible types of credit claim.
4. A syndicated loan share shall be an eligible type of credit claim. For the purposes of this Section, a syndicated loan
share means a credit claim resulting from the participation of a lender in a loan provided by a group of lenders in a
lending syndicate.
5. A credit claim granted in a context other than a mere lending relationship may constitute an eligible type of asset.
A claim inherent to certain leasing or factoring structures may qualify as an eligible type of asset, if it constitutes a credit
claim. Claims purchased under a factoring only qualify as an eligible type of asset to the extent they actually constitute
credit claims as opposed to other claims, such as purchase price claims.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/49 
Article 90
Principal amount and coupons of credit claims
In order to be eligible, credit claims shall comply, until final redemption, with the following requirements:
(a) a fixed, unconditional principal amount; and
(b) an interest rate that cannot result in a negative cash flow, whereby the interest rate shall be one of the following:
(i) a ‘zero-coupon’;
(ii) fixed;
(iii) floating, i.e. linked to another interest rate reference or to the inflation rate.
Article 91
Non-subordination
Credit claims may not afford rights to the principal and/or the interest that are subordinated to: (a) the rights of holders
of other unsecured debt obligations of the debtor including other shares or sub-shares in the same syndicated loan; and
(b) the rights of holders of debt instruments of the same issuer.
Article 92
Credit quality requirements for credit claims
The credit quality of credit claims is assessed on the basis of the credit quality of the debtor or guarantor. The relevant
debtor or guarantor shall comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements as specified in the ECAF rules for
credit claims laid down in Chapter 2 of Title III of Part Four.
Article 93
Minimum size of credit claims
For domestic use, credit claims shall, at the time of their submission as collateral by the counterparty, meet a minimum
size threshold laid down by the home NCB. For cross-border use, a minimum size threshold of EUR 500 000 shall
apply.
Article 94
Currency of denomination of credit claims
Credit claims shall be denominated in euro or in one of the former currencies of the Member States whose currency is
the euro.
Article 95
Type of debtor or guarantor
1. The debtors and guarantors of eligible credit claims shall be non-financial corporations, public sector entities,
multilateral development banks or international organisations. For the purposes of this Article, a multilateral
development bank or an international organisation may be recognised by the Eurosystem in the same manner as
described in Article 69(2).
2. If a credit claim has more than one debtor, each debtor shall be individually and severally liable for the full
repayment of the entire credit claim.
Article 96
Location of the debtor or guarantor
1. The debtor in respect of a credit claim shall be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro.
L 91/50 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
2. The guarantor in respect of a credit claim shall also be established in a Member State whose currency is the euro,
unless a guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets because there is
an adequate credit assessment of the debtor.
3. For debtors or guarantors that are multilateral development banks or international organisations, the rules in
paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply and they shall be eligible irrespective of their place of establishment.
Article 97
Governing laws
The credit claim agreement and the agreement between the counterparty and the home NCB mobilising the credit claim
as collateral shall both be governed by the law of a Member State whose currency is the euro. Furthermore, there shall
be no more than two governing laws in total that apply to the:
(a) counterparty;
(b) creditor;
(c) debtor;
(d) guarantor (if relevant);
(e) credit claim agreement;
(f) the agreement between the counterparty and the home NCB mobilising the credit claim as collateral.
Article 98
Handling procedures
Credit claims shall be handled in accordance with the Eurosystem procedures laid down in the relevant national
documentation of the NCBs.
Article 99
Additional legal requirements for credit claims
1. In order to ensure that a valid security is created over credit claims and that the credit claim can be swiftly realised
in the event of a counterparty default, additional legal requirements shall be met. These legal requirements relate to:
(a) verification of the existence of credit claims;
(b) notification of the debtor about mobilisation of the credit claim or the registration of such mobilisation;
(c) an absence of restrictions on the mobilisation of the credit claim;
(d) an absence of restrictions on the realisation of the credit claim;
(e) an absence of restrictions related to banking secrecy and confidentiality.
2. The content of these legal requirements is set out in Articles 100 to 105. Further details of the specific features of
the national jurisdictions are provided in the relevant national documentation of the NCBs.
Article 100
Verifications of the procedures used to submit credit claims
NCBs, or supervisors or external auditors, shall conduct a one-off verification of the appropriateness of the procedures
used by the counterparty to submit the information on credit claims to the Eurosystem.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/51 
Article 101
Verification of existence of credit claims
1. The NCBs shall, as a minimum, take all of the following steps to verify the existence of credit claims mobilised as
collateral:
(a) They shall obtain a written confirmation from counterparties, at least each quarter, by which counterparties shall
confirm:
(i) the existence of the credit claims (this confirmation could be replaced with cross-checks of information held in
central credit registers, where these exist);
(ii) the compliance of credit claims with the eligibility criteria applied by the Eurosystem;
(iii) that such credit claim is not used simultaneously as collateral to the benefit of any third party and that the
counterparty shall not mobilise such credit claim as collateral to any third party;
(iv) that the counterparty will undertake to communicate to the relevant NCB no later than within the course of the
next business day, any event that materially affects the contractual relationship between the counterparty and
the NCB, in particular early, partial or total repayments, downgrades and material changes in the conditions of
the credit claim.
(b) They, or relevant central credit registers, banking supervision competent authorities or external auditors, shall
perform random checks in respect of the quality and accuracy of the written confirmation of counterparties, by
means of delivery of physical documentation or through on-site visits. The information checked in relation to each
credit claim shall cover as a minimum the characteristics that determine the existence and the eligibility of credit
claims. For counterparties with ECAF-approved internal ratings-based (IRB) systems, additional checks on the credit
quality assessment of credit claims shall be carried out involving checks of PDs with respect to debtors of credit
claims that are used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.
2. For the checks that are undertaken in accordance with Article 100 or paragraphs 1(a) and (b) of this Article by
NCBs, supervisors, external auditors or central credit registers, those undertaking the checks shall be authorised to carry
out these investigations, if necessary contractually or in accordance with the applicable national requirements.
Article 102
Validity of the agreement for the mobilisation of credit claims
The agreement for the mobilisation of the credit claim as collateral shall be valid between the counterparty and the
relevant NCB under the applicable national law. All the necessary legal formalities to ensure the validity of the
agreement and to ensure the mobilisation of a credit claims as collateral shall be fulfilled by the counterparty and/or the
transferee, as appropriate.
Article 103
Full effect of the mobilisation vis-à-vis third parties
1. The agreement for the mobilisation of the credit claim as collateral shall be valid vis-à-vis third parties under the
applicable national law. All legal formalities necessary to ensure valid mobilisation shall be fulfilled by the counterparty
and/or the transferee, as appropriate.
2. As regards notification of the debtor, the following shall apply, depending on the applicable national law.
(a) If debtor notification or public registration of the mobilisation of a credit claim as collateral is necessary to ensure
full effectiveness of the mobilisation vis-à-vis third parties, and in particular to ensure the priority of the home
NCB's security interest vis-à-vis other creditors, these notification or registration requirements shall be completed in
advance or at the time of the credit claim's actual mobilisation as collateral.
(b) If ex ante notification of the debtor or public registration of the mobilisation of a credit claim as collateral is not
required in accordance with point (a), as specified in the applicable national documentation, ex post notification of
the debtor is required. Ex post notification means that the debtor shall be notified by the counterparty or the home
NCB, as specified by the national documentation, about the credit claim being mobilised as collateral by the
counterparty to the benefit of the NCB immediately following an event of default or similar credit event as further
specified in the applicable national documentation.
L 91/52 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
(c) The NCBs may decide to require ex ante notification or public registration in advance or at the time of mobilisation,
even if these formalities are not necessary for the purposes set out in point (a).
(d) For credit claims that are bearer instruments, the home NCB may require that such bearer instruments are physically
transferred to it or to a third party in advance, or at the time of actual mobilisation as collateral. The notification
requirements set out in points (a) and (b) shall not apply to credit claims that are bearer instruments.
3. The above are minimum requirements. NCBs may decide to require ex ante notification or registration in addition
to the situations above, including in the case of bearer instruments.
Article 104
Absence of restrictions concerning mobilisation and realisation of credit claims
1. Credit claims shall be fully transferable and capable of being mobilised without restriction for the benefit of the
Eurosystem. The credit claim agreement or other contractual arrangements between the counterparty and the debtor
shall not contain any restrictive provisions on mobilisation as collateral, unless national legislation provides that such
contractual restrictions are without prejudice to the Eurosystem with respect to the mobilisation of collateral.
2. The credit claim agreement or other contractual arrangements between the counterparty and the debtor shall not
contain any restrictive provisions regarding the realisation of the credit claim used as collateral for Eurosystem credit
operations, including any form, time or other requirement with regard to realisation.
3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, the provisions restricting the assignment of syndicated loan shares to banks,
financial institutions and entities which are regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of creating, purchasing or
investing in loans, securities or other financial assets shall not be considered as a restriction on the realisation of the
credit claim.
4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a facility agent for the collection and distribution of payments and administration
of the loan shall not be considered as a restriction on the mobilisation and realisation of a syndicated loan share,
provided that: (a) the facility agent is a credit institution located in the Union; and (b) the service relationship between
the relevant syndicate member and the facility agent can be transferred alongside or as part of the syndicated loan share.
Article 105
Absence of restrictions concerning banking secrecy and confidentiality
The counterparty and the debtor shall have agreed contractually that the debtor unconditionally consents to disclosure
by the counterparty to the Eurosystem of details in respect of the credit claim and on the debtor that are required by the
home NCB for the purpose of ensuring that a valid security is created over credit claims and that the credit claims can
be swiftly realised in the event of a counterparty default. This requirement shall not be necessary if unrestricted
provision of such information is ensured under the applicable national law, as specified in the applicable national
documentation of the home NCB.
Section 2
Eligibility c riteria for fi xed-term deposits
Article 106
Eligibility criteria for fixed-term deposits
Fixed-term deposits, as described in Article 12, that are held by a counterparty shall be eligible assets as collateral for
Eurosystem credit operations.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/53 
Section 3
Eligibility c riteria for RMBDs
Article 107
Eligibility criteria for RMBDs
1. An RMBD shall be a promissory note or a bill of exchange that is secured by a pool of residential mortgages but
falls short of full securitisation. Substitution of assets in the underlying pool shall be possible and a mechanism shall be
in place to ensure that the home NCB enjoys priority over creditors other than those exempted for public policy
reasons.
2. RMBDs shall have a fixed, unconditional principal amount and an interest rate that cannot result in a negative cash
flow.
3. RMBDs shall comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements specified in the ECAF rules for RMBDs as
laid down in Chapter 2 of Title III of this Part Four.
4. RMBDs shall be issued by credit institutions that are counterparties which are established in a Member State whose
currency is the euro.
5. RMBDs shall be denominated in euro or in one of the former currencies of Member States whose currency is the
euro.
6. An issuer of RMBDs shall self-certify, as a minimum on a monthly basis, that the residential mortgages that form
the cover pool comply with the eligibility criteria specified in the national arrangements established by the home NCB
and on which the credit assessment is based.
7. The mobilisation, use and handling procedures in respect of RMBDs shall be subject to the Eurosystem procedures
as defined in the national documentation of the home NCB.
CHAPTER 2
Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets
Article 108
Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets
In order for non-marketable assets to be eligible, the following Eurosystem credit quality requirements shall apply.
(a) For credit claims, the credit quality of credit claims shall be assessed on the basis of the credit quality of the debtor
or guarantor, which shall comply, as a minimum, with credit quality step 3, as specified in the Eurosystem's
harmonised rating scale.
(b) For RMBDs, a credit quality assessment shall comply, as a minimum, with credit quality step 2, as specified in the
Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.
Section 1
Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for credit claims
Article 109
General rules for the credit quality assessment of credit claims
1. The Eurosystem shall assess the credit quality of credit claims on the basis of the credit quality of the debtors or
guarantors provided by the credit assessment system or source selected by the counterparty in accordance with
Article 110.
2. Counterparties shall within the course of the next business day inform the relevant NCB of any credit event,
including a delay in payments by the debtors of the credit claims mobilised as collateral, that is known to the
counterparty and, if requested by the relevant NCB, withdraw or replace the assets.
3. Counterparties shall be responsible for ensuring that they use the most recent credit quality assessment available
from their selected credit assessment system or source for the debtors or guarantors of credit claims mobilised as
collateral.
L 91/54 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
Article 110
Selection of the credit assessment system or source
1. Counterparties mobilising credit claims as collateral shall select one credit assessment system from one of the four
credit assessment sources accepted by the Eurosystem in accordance with the general acceptance criteria in Title V of
Part Four. Where the ECAI source is selected by counterparties, any ECAI system may be used.
2. Further to paragraph 1, NCBs may allow counterparties to use more than one credit assessment system or source
upon submission of a reasoned request to the home NCB supported by an adequate business case based on the lack of
sufficient coverage of the ‘main’ credit assessment source or system.
3. In cases where counterparties are allowed to use more than one credit assessment system or credit assessment
source, the ‘main’ system or source is expected to be the one providing the credit quality assessment of the largest
number of debtors from the credit claims mobilised as collateral. If a credit assessment for a debtor or guarantor is
available from this main system or source, only this credit assessment shall determine the eligibility and valuation
haircuts applicable to the debtor or guarantor.
4. Counterparties shall use the selected credit assessment systems or sources for a minimum period of 12 months.
5. After the period specified in paragraph 4, counterparties may submit an explicit reasoned request to the home
NCB to change the selected credit assessment system or source.
6. In certain circumstances and particularly when a counterparty phases-in its IRB system or begins using credit
claims as collateral, upon submission of a reasoned request, an NCB may exceptionally grant a derogation to a
counterparty with respect to the 12-month minimum period restriction specified in paragraph 4 and allow the
counterparty to change its selected credit assessment system or source within that period.
7. If the counterparty has chosen the ECAI credit assessment source, it may use an ECAI debtor or ECAI guarantor
rating. If multiple ECAI debtor and/or ECAI guarantor ratings are available for the same credit claim, then the best
available ECAI credit assessment of those may be used.
Article 111
Credit assessment of credit claims with public sector entities, or non-financial corporations, as debtors or
guarantors
1. The Eurosystem shall assess the credit quality of credit claims with public sector entities acting as debtors or
guarantors in accordance with the following rules, applied in the following order.
(a) If a credit assessment from the system or source selected by the counterparty exists, the Eurosystem shall use it to
establish whether the public sector entity acting as debtor or guarantor meets the Eurosystem's credit quality
requirements for non-marketable assets laid down in Article 108.
(b) In the absence of a credit assessment under point (a), the Eurosystem shall use an ECAI credit assessment provided
by an accepted ECAI system for the public sector entity acting as debtor or guarantor.
(c) If a credit assessment is unavailable pursuant to points (a) or (b), the procedure laid down in Article 87 for
marketable assets shall apply to the relevant public sector entity as debtor or guarantor.
2. The Eurosystem shall assess the credit quality of credit claims with non-financial corporations as debtors or
guarantors as follows: the credit assessment provided by the credit assessment system or source selected by the
counterparty shall meet the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets laid down in Article 108.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/55 
Section 2
Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for RMBDs
Article 112
Establishment of Eurosystem's credit quality requirements for RMBDs
For the purpose of meeting the credit quality requirements laid down in Article 108, the home NCB shall assess the
credit quality of RMBDs on the basis of a jurisdiction-specific credit quality assessment framework laid down in the
applicable national documentation.
TITLE IV
GUARANTEES FOR MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS
Article 113
Applicable requirements for guarantees
1. The Eurosystem's credit quality requirements may be established on the basis of credit assessments provided in
respect of guarantors in accordance with Articles 82 to 84 in respect of marketable assets and Article 108 in respect of
credit claims.
2. Guarantees provided by guarantors that are required to establish the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements shall
comply with this Title.
3. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the relevant guarantor shall be separately assessed on the basis of its credit
assessment and shall meet the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements.
Article 114
Features of the guarantee
1. In accordance with the terms of the guarantee, the guarantor shall provide an unconditional and irrevocable
first-demand guarantee in respect of the obligations of the issuer or debtor in relation to the payment of the principal,
interest and any other amounts due under the marketable asset or credit claim to the holders or creditor thereof, until
the marketable asset or credit claim is discharged in full. In this regard, a guarantee shall not be required to be specific to
the marketable asset or credit claim but may apply to the issuer or debtor only, provided that the relevant marketable
asset or credit claim is covered by the guarantee.
2. The guarantee shall be payable on first demand independently of the guaranteed marketable asset or credit claim.
Guarantees given by public sector entities with the right to levy taxes shall either be payable on first demand or
otherwise provide for prompt and punctual payment following any default.
3. The guarantee shall be legally valid, binding and enforceable against the guarantor.
4. The guarantee shall be governed by the law of a Member State.
5. If the guarantor is not a public sector entity with the right to levy taxes, a legal confirmation concerning the legal
validity, binding effect and enforceability of the guarantee shall be submitted to the relevant NCB in a form and
substance acceptable to the Eurosystem before the marketable assets or credit claim supported by the guarantee can be
considered eligible. The legal confirmation shall also state that the guarantee is not a personal one and is only
enforceable by the holders of the marketable assets or the creditor of the credit claim. If the guarantor is established in a
jurisdiction other than the one of the law governing the guarantee, the legal confirmation shall also confirm that the
guarantee is valid and enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which the guarantor is established. For marketable
assets, the legal confirmation shall be submitted by the counterparty for review to the NCB that is reporting the relevant
asset supported by a guarantee for inclusion in the list of eligible assets. For credit claims, the legal confirmation shall be
submitted by the counterparty seeking to mobilise the credit claim for review to the NCB in the jurisdiction of the law
governing the credit claim. The requirement of enforceability is subject to any insolvency or bankruptcy laws, general
principles of equity and other similar laws and principles applicable to the guarantor and generally affecting creditors'
rights against the guarantor.
L 91/56 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
Article 115
Non-subordination of the obligations of the guarantor
The obligations of the guarantor under the guarantee shall at least rank equally, pari passu, and rateably, pro rata, with all
other unsecured obligations of the guarantor.
Article 116
Credit quality requirements for guarantors
The guarantor shall comply with the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements specified under the ECAF rules for
guarantors of marketable assets laid down in Articles 82 to 84 or with the rules for guarantors of credit claims laid
down in Article 108.
Article 117
Type of guarantor
The guarantor shall be:
(a) for marketable assets in accordance with Article 69: a central bank of a Member State, a public sector entity, an
agency, a credit institution, a financial corporation other than a credit institution, a non-financial corporation, a
multilateral development bank or an international organisation; or
(b) for credit claims in accordance with Article 95: a non-financial corporation, a public sector entity, a multilateral
development bank or an international organisation.
Article 118
Place of establishment of guarantor
1. The guarantor shall be established:
(a) in the case of marketable assets in accordance with Article 70, in the EEA, unless a guarantee is not needed to
establish the credit quality requirements for a specific debt instrument. The possibility to use an ECAI guarantor
rating to establish the relevant credit quality requirements for marketable assets is addressed in Article 84.
(b) for debt instruments guaranteed by non-financial corporations for which no credit assessment has been provided by
an accepted ECAI for the issue, the issuer or the guarantor, in accordance with Article 70, the guarantor shall be
established in a Member State whose currency is the euro;
(c) in the case of credit claims in accordance with Article 96, in a Member State whose currency is the euro, unless a
guarantee is not needed to establish the credit quality requirements for non-marketable assets. The option to use a
credit assessment in respect of a guarantor to establish the relevant credit quality requirements for credit claims is
addressed in Article 108.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, in accordance with Articles 70 and 96, multilateral development banks and international
organisations shall be eligible guarantors irrespective of their place of establishment.
TITLE V
EUROSYSTEM CREDIT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK FOR ELIGIBLE ASSETS
Article 119
Accepted credit assessment sources and systems
1. The credit assessment information on which the Eurosystem bases the eligibility assessment of assets eligible as
collateral for Eurosystem credit operations shall be provided by credit assessment systems belonging to one of the
four following sources:
(a) ECAIs;
(b) NCBs' in-house credit assessment systems (ICASs);
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/57 
(c) counterparties' internal rating-based (IRB) systems;
(d) third-party rating tool (RT) providers.
2. Under each credit assessment source listed in paragraph 1 there may be a set of credit assessment systems. Credit
assessment systems shall comply with the acceptance criteria laid down in this Title. A list of the accepted credit
assessment systems, i.e. the list of accepted ECAIs, ICASs and RTs, is published on the ECB's website.
3. All accepted credit assessment systems shall be subject to the ECAF performance monitoring process as laid down
in Article 126.
4. By publishing information on the accepted credit assessment systems in conjunction with its Eurosystem credit
operations, the Eurosystem shall not assume any responsibility for its evaluation of accepted credit assessment systems.
5. In the event of an infringement of the ECAF rules and procedures, the relevant credit assessment system may be
excluded from the ECAF-accepted systems.
Article 120
General acceptance criteria for external credit assessment institutions as credit assessment systems
1. For the purposes of the ECAF, the general acceptance criteria for ECAIs shall be the following:
(a) ECAIs shall be registered or certified by the European Securities and Markets Authority, in accordance with
Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.
(b) ECAIs shall fulfil operational criteria and provide relevant coverage so as to ensure the efficient implementation of
the ECAF. In particular, the use of an ECAI credit assessment is subject to the availability to the Eurosystem of
information on these assessments, as well as information for the comparison and the assignment, i.e. mapping, of
the assessments to the Eurosystem's credit quality steps and for the purposes of the performance monitoring
process, under Article 126.
2. The Eurosystem reserves the right to decide whether it accepts an ECAI for the purposes of ECAF, taking into
account, among other factors, the criteria and rules of the ECAF performance monitoring process.
3. Together with the submitted data for ECAF performance monitoring in accordance with Article 126, the ECAI
shall submit a signed certification from the CEO of the ECAI, or authorised signatory with responsibility for the audit or
compliance function within the ECAI, confirming the accuracy and validity of the submitted performance monitoring
information.
Article 121
General acceptance criteria and operational procedures for the NCBs' in-house credit assessment systems
1. NCBs may decide to use their own ICAS for the purpose of credit assessment. The decision of an NCB to use its
own ICAS shall be subject to a validation procedure by the Eurosystem.
2. A credit assessment by means of ICAS may be performed in advance, or on a counterparty's specific request upon
submission of an asset to the NCB using ICAS (the ‘ICAS NCB’).
3. With regard to paragraph 2, upon submission of an asset to the ICAS NCB in respect of which the eligibility of a
debtor or guarantor shall be assessed, the ICAS NCB informs the counterparty either of its eligibility status or of the lead
time necessary to establish a credit assessment. If an ICAS is limited in scope and only assesses specific types of debtors
or guarantors, or if the ICAS NCB is unable to receive the information and data necessary for its credit assessment, the
ICAS NCB will inform the counterparty thereof without delay. In both cases, the relevant debtor or guarantor is
considered ineligible, unless the assets are compliant with credit quality requirements in accordance with an alternative
L 91/58 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
credit assessment source or credit assessment system which the counterparty is allowed to use according to Article 110.
In the event that mobilised assets become ineligible due to the deterioration of the creditworthiness of the debtor or the
guarantor, the asset shall be removed at the earliest possible date. Since there is neither a contractual relationship
between the non-financial corporations and the ICAS NCB, nor any legal obligation for these corporations to provide
non-public information to the ICAS NCB, the information is provided on a voluntary basis.
4. In countries in which RMBDs are mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations, the home NCB shall
implement a credit assessment framework for this type of asset in accordance with the ECAF. Such frameworks shall be
subject to a validation procedure by the Eurosystem and to a yearly performance monitoring process, as further
specified in Article 126.
Article 122
General acceptance criteria for internal ratings-based systems
1. To obtain ECAF approval of an IRB system, a counterparty shall file a request with the home NCB.
2. The requirement in paragraph 1 shall apply to all counterparties intending to use an IRB system regardless of their
status, i.e. parent, subsidiary or branch, and regardless of whether the endorsement of the IRB system comes from the
competent authority in the same country, for a parent company and possibly for subsidiaries, or from a competent
authority in the home country of the parent, for branches and possibly for subsidiaries.
3. A request filed by a counterparty in accordance with paragraph 1 shall include the following information and
documents which, if necessary, shall be translated into a working language of the home NCB:
(a) a copy of the decision of the competent authority authorising the counterparty to use its IRB system for capital
requirements purposes on a consolidated or non-consolidated basis, together with any specific conditions for such
use;
(b) a copy of the most up-to-date assessment of the counterparty's IRB system by the competent authority;
(c) information on any changes to the counterparty's IRB system recommended or required by the competent authority,
together with the deadline by which such changes must be implemented;
(d) information on its approach to assigning probabilities of default to debtors, as well as data on the rating grades and
associated one-year probabilities of default used to determine eligible rating grades;
(e) a copy of the latest Pillar 3 (market discipline) information that the counterparty is required to publish on a regular
basis in accordance with the requirements on market discipline under the Basel III Framework, Directive
2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(f) the name and the address of the competent authority and the external auditor;
(g) information on the historical record of the counterparty's IRB system's observed default rates per rating grades
covering the five calendar years preceding the relevant request. If the competent authority granted the IRB system's
authorisation for capital requirements purposes during these calendar years, the information shall cover the time
since the IRB system's authorisation for capital requirements purposes. The historical annual data on the observed
default rates and potential additional information shall comply with the provisions for performance monitoring in
Article 126 as if the IRB system had been subject to these provisions over this time period;
(h) information required for performance monitoring outlined in Article 126 as requested from already ECAF-approved
IRB systems for the ongoing calendar year at the time of the filing of the request.
4. A counterparty shall not be required to file the information under points (a) to (c) when such information is
transmitted directly by the competent authority to the home NCB upon the NCB's request.
5. The request made by the counterparty under paragraph 1 shall be signed by the counterparty's CEO, CFO or a
manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on behalf of one of them.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/59 
Article 123
Reporting obligations of counterparties using an internal ratings-based system
1. Counterparties shall communicate information to the home NCB on Article 122(3)(b) to (f) on an annual basis, or
as and when required by the home NCB, unless such information is transmitted directly by the competent authority to
the home NCB upon the NCB's request.
2. The annual communication referred to in paragraph 1 shall be signed by the counterparty's CEO, CFO or a
manager of similar seniority, or by an authorised signatory on behalf of one of them. The competent authority and,
where applicable, the external auditor of the counterparty shall receive a copy of this letter from the Eurosystem.
3. As part of the regular monitoring on IRB systems, the NCB shall perform on- and off-site inspections on the
statistical information provided by counterparties for the purpose of the annual performance monitoring process. The
objective of such controls shall be to verify that static pools are correct, accurate and complete.
4. Counterparties shall fulfil any further operational criteria specified in the relevant contractual or regulatory
arrangements applied by the home NCB, including provisions in relation to:
(a) ad hoc checks on the procedures in place for communicating a credit claim's features to the home NCB;
(b) annual checks by the home NCB (or, where relevant, the competent authority or external auditor) to establish the
accuracy and validity of static pools as referred to in Annex IX;
(c) the provision, no later than within the course of the next business day, of information in respect of eligibility
changes and the immediate withdrawal of relevant credit claims, if necessary;
(d) notifications to the home NCB of facts or circumstances that could materially influence the continued use of the IRB
system for ECAF purposes or the way in which the IRB system leads to the establishment of eligible collateral,
including in particular material changes to a counterparty's IRB system which may impact on the manner in which
the IRB system's rating grades or probabilities of default correspond with the Eurosystem harmonised rating scale.
Article 124
General acceptance criteria for third-party rating tool providers as credit assessment systems
1. The third-party rating tool (RT) provider source shall encompass entities that assess the credit quality of debtors by
using primarily quantitative models in a systematic and mechanical manner, relying amongst other information on
audited accounts, and whose credit assessments are not intended for general public disclosure.
2. An RT provider wishing to participate in the ECAF shall submit a request to the relevant NCB, using the template
provided by the Eurosystem, supplemented by additional documentation as specified in the template provided on the
ECB's website.
3. Counterparties wishing to use a specific RT provider for ECAF purposes that is not accepted by the Eurosystem
shall submit a request to the relevant NCB, using the template provided on the ECB's website, supplemented by
additional documentation as specified in this template.
4. In respect of submissions made under paragraphs 2 and 3, the Eurosystem shall decide whether to accept the RT
provider based on an evaluation of compliance with the acceptance criteria set by the Eurosystem, as published on the
ECB's website.
5. Counterparties using a RT provider shall promptly inform the relevant RT provider of any credit event that is
known only to the counterparty that may indicate a deterioration of the credit quality, including a delay in payments by
the debtors of the eligible assets mobilised as collateral.
L 91/60 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
Article 125
Reporting obligation for third-party rating tool providers
1. The RT provider shall communicate the required information for the purposes of the ECAF performance
monitoring report to the relevant NCB together with a signed certification from the CEO, or authorised signatory with
responsibility for the audit or compliance function within the RT, confirming the accuracy and validity of the submitted
performance monitoring data.
2. The RT provider shall undertake to keep internal records of static pools and default details for five years.
Article 126
ECAF performance monitoring process
1. On an annual basis, all accepted credit assessment systems shall be subject to the ECAF performance monitoring
process, in accordance with Annex IX, for the purpose of ensuring that the mapping of the credit assessment
information provided by the credit assessment system to the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale remains appropriate
and that the results from credit assessments are comparable across systems and sources.
2. The Eurosystem reserves the right to request any additional information required to conduct the performance
monitoring process.
3. The performance monitoring process may result in a correction of the manner in which the credit assessment
information provided by the credit assessment system corresponds to the Eurosystem's harmonised rating scale.
4. The Eurosystem may decide to suspend or exclude a credit assessment system on the basis of the outcome of the
performance monitoring process.
5. In the event of an infringement of a rule related to the ECAF performance monitoring process, the relevant credit
assessment system may be excluded from the list of ECAF-accepted systems.
TITLE VI
RISK CONTROL AND VALUATION FRAMEWORK OF MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS
Article 127
Purpose of the risk control and valuation framework
1. Eligible assets mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations shall be subject to the risk control measures
laid down in Article 128(1), which aim to protecting the Eurosystem against the risk of financial loss in the event of a
counterparty's default.
2. The Eurosystem may at any time apply additional risk control measures, as laid down in Article 128(2), if required
to ensure adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem in line with Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB. Additional risk
control measures may also be applied at the level of individual counterparties, if required to ensure such protection.
3. All risk control measures applied by the Eurosystem shall ensure consistent, transparent and non-discriminatory
conditions for any type of mobilised eligible asset across the Member States whose currency is the euro.

(b) variation margins (marking-to-market):
the Eurosystem requires the haircut-adjusted market value of the eligible assets used in its liquidity-providing reverse
transactions to be maintained over time. If the value of the eligible assets, which are measured on a daily basis, falls
below a certain level, the home NCB shall require the counterparty to supply additional assets or cash by way of a
margin call. Similarly, if the value of the eligible assets exceeds a certain level following their revaluation, the NCB
may return the excess assets or cash;
(c) limits in relation to the use of unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or by any other entity with
which that credit institution has close links as described in Article 138;
(d) valuation markdowns.
2. The Eurosystem may apply the following additional risk control measures:
(a) initial margins, meaning that counterparties provide eligible assets with a value at least equal to the liquidity
provided by the Eurosystem plus the value of the relevant initial margin;
(b) limits in relation to issuers, debtors or guarantors:
the Eurosystem may apply additional limits, other than those applied to the use of unsecured debt instruments
referred to in paragraph (1)(c), to the exposure vis-à-vis issuers, debtors or guarantors;
(c) supplementary haircuts;
(d) additional guarantees from guarantors meeting the Eurosystem's credit quality requirements in order to accept
certain assets;
(e) the exclusion of certain assets from use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.
CHAPTER 1
Risk control measures for marketable assets
Article 129
Establishment of risk control measures for marketable assets
1. For the purpose of establishing the applicable risk control measures, eligible marketable assets shall be allocated to
one of the following five haircut categories, based on the type of issuer and/or type of asset and as reflected in Table 10:
(a) debt instruments issued by central governments, ECB debt certificates and debt certificates issued by NCBs prior to
the date of adoption of the euro in their respective Member State whose currency is the euro are included in haircut
category I;
(b) debt instruments issued by local and regional government, entities classified as agencies by the Eurosystem,
multilateral development banks and international organisations, as well as jumbo covered bonds, are included in
haircut category II;
(c) traditional covered bonds, other covered bonds and debt instruments issued by non-financial corporations are
included in haircut category III;
(d) unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions and by financial corporations other than credit institutions
are included in haircut category IV;
(e) asset-backed securities are included in haircut category V, regardless of the classification of the issuer.
L 91/62 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
2. The haircut categories for marketable assets are summarised in the table below, taking into account the classification
of the issuer.

Article 130
Valuation haircuts for marketable assets
1. Marketable assets shall be subject to specific valuation haircuts, applied by deducting a certain percentage from the
market value of the relevant asset. The specific valuation haircuts applied to debt instruments included in haircut
categories I to IV as laid down in Annex X differ in accordance with any or all of the following factors:
(a) residual maturity;
(b) coupon structure;
(c) credit quality step;
(d) haircut category, as determined pursuant to Article 129.
2. Marketable assets included in category V shall be subject to a haircut of 10 % regardless of maturity or coupon
structure.
3. ABSs, covered bonds and unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions that are theoretically valued in
accordance with the rules contained in Article 134 shall be subject to an additional valuation haircut in the form of a
valuation markdown of 5 %.
4. Own-use covered bonds shall be subject to an additional valuation haircut applied directly to the value of the
entire issuance of the individual debt instrument in the form of a valuation markdown of: (a) 8 % for own-use covered
bonds in credit quality steps 1 and 2, and (b) 12 % for own-use covered bonds in credit quality step 3. For the purposes
of this paragraph, ‘own-use covered bonds’ means covered bonds issued by either a counterparty or entities closely
linked to it, and used in a percentage greater than 75 % of the outstanding notional amount by that counterparty and/or
its closely linked entities. ‘Close links’ for the purposes of this paragraph shall be determined in accordance with
Article 138. This valuation markdown applies to all counterparties mobilising the covered bond in question.
5. The valuation haircut applied to marketable assets included in haircut categories I to IV with floating coupons
shall be that applied to the zero-to-one-year residual maturity of fixed coupon marketable assets in the haircut category
and credit quality step to which the asset is assigned. For the purposes of this Article, coupon payments for which the
resetting period is longer than one year are treated as fixed rate payments, and the relevant maturity for the valuation
haircut to be applied shall be the residual maturity of the marketable asset.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/63 
6. The valuation haircuts applicable to marketable assets included in categories I to IV with more than one type of
coupon payment shall solely depend on the coupon payments arising during the remaining life of the instrument. The
valuation haircut applicable to such an instrument shall equal the highest haircut applicable to a marketable asset with
the same residual maturity and credit quality step, and coupon payments of any one of the types occurring in the
remaining life of the instrument may be considered.
7. The valuation haircut levels applied to fixed coupon debt instruments shall also apply to debt instruments where
the relevant coupon is linked to inflation-indexed debt instruments.
8. No valuation haircuts shall be applied in liquidity-absorbing operations.
CHAPTER 2
Risk control measures for non-marketable assets
Article 131
Establishment of risk control measures for credit claims
1. Individual credit claims with a fixed rate of interest payment and credit claims with a rate of interest payments
linked to the inflation rate shall be subject to specific valuation haircuts determined according to the residual maturity,
the credit quality step and the valuation methodology applied by the NCB, as laid down in Annex X.
2. Individual credit claims with a variable interest rate shall be subject to the valuation haircut applied to the credit
claims with fixed interest rate classified in the zero-to-one-year residual maturity corresponding to the same credit
quality step and the same valuation methodology as applied by the NCB. For the purposes of this Article, an interest
payment shall be treated as a variable rate payment if it is linked to a reference interest rate and if the resetting period
corresponding to this payment is no longer than one year. Interest payments for which the resetting period is longer
than one year shall be treated as fixed-rate payments, with the relevant maturity for the haircut being the residual
maturity of the credit claim.
3. The valuation haircut applied to a credit claim with more than one type of interest payment shall depend only on
the interest payments during the remaining life of the credit claim. If there is more than one type of interest payment
during the remaining life of the credit claim, the remaining interest payments shall be treated as fixed-rate payments,
with the relevant maturity for the haircut being the residual maturity of the credit claim.
Article 132
Risk control measures for RMBDs
Non-marketable RMBDs shall be subject to a valuation haircut of 39,5 %.
Article 133
Risk control measures for fixed-term deposits
Fixed-term deposits shall not be subject to valuation haircuts, in line with the approach for marketable assets laid down
in Article 130 for liquidity-absorbing operations.
CHAPTER 3
Valuation rules for marketable and non-marketable assets
Article 134
Valuation rules for marketable assets
For the purposes of determining the value of assets used as collateral in open market operations conducted by means of
reverse transactions, the NCBs shall apply the following rules.
(a) For each eligible marketable asset, the Eurosystem shall define the most representative price to be used for the
calculation of the market value.
(b) A marketable asset's value shall be calculated on the basis of the most representative price on the business day
preceding its valuation date. In the absence of a representative price for a particular asset the Eurosystem shall define
a theoretical price.
L 91/64 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
(c) The market or theoretical value of a marketable asset shall be calculated including accrued interest.
(d) Depending on differences in national legal systems and operational practices, the treatment of income flows, e.g.
coupon payments that are related to an asset and are received during the life of a Eurosystem credit operation, may
differ between NCBs. If the income flow is transferred to the counterparty, the home NCB shall ensure that the
relevant operations will still be fully covered by a sufficient amount of eligible assets before the transfer of the
income takes place. Each NCB shall aim to ensure that the economic effect of the treatment of income flows is
equivalent to a situation in which the income is transferred to the counterparty on the payment day.
Article 135
Valuation rules for non-marketable assets
Non-marketable assets shall be assigned a value by the Eurosystem corresponding either to the theoretical price or to the
outstanding amount.
Article 136
Margin calls
1. Assets mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations shall be subject to daily valuation by NCBs, in
accordance with the valuation rules laid down in Articles 134 and 135. If tri-party services are used, the daily valuation
process shall be delegated to the relevant TPA and shall be based on information sent by the relevant NCB to the TPA.
2. If, after valuation and haircuts, the mobilised assets do not match the requirements as calculated on that day,
margin calls shall be performed. If the value of the eligible assets mobilised as collateral by a counterparty, following
their revaluation, exceeds the amount owed by the counterparty plus the variation margin, the NCB may return the
excess assets or any cash that the counterparty has provided for a margin call.
3. In order to reduce the frequency of margin calls, an NCB may apply a threshold of 0,5 % of the amount of
liquidity provided. Depending on the applicable national law, if the value of the mobilised assets as collateral falls below
the lower threshold, NCBs may require margin calls to be effected either through the supply of additional assets or by
means of cash payments by the counterparty. Conversely, if the value of the assets used as collateral exceeds the upper
threshold, the NCB may return the excess assets (or cash submitted to meet a margin call) to the counterparty.
4. The deposit facility rate shall also apply to cash margins.
TITLE VII
ACCEPTANCE OF NON EURO-DENOMINATED COLLATERAL IN CONTINGENCIES
Article 137
Acceptance of non-euro-denominated collateral in contingencies
1. The ECB's Governing Council may decide to accept certain marketable assets issued by non-euro area G10 central
governments in their national currency as collateral. Upon such a decision by the ECB's Governing Council, counterparties
shall be informed about the applicable:
(a) eligibility criteria;
(b) procedures for selection and mobilisation;
(c) sources and principles of valuation;
(d) risk control measures;
(e) settlement procedures.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/65 
2. The general eligibility criteria for marketable assets laid down in Title II of Part Four shall apply, except that
marketable assets:
(a) may be issued, held and settled outside the EEA; and
(b) may be denominated in currencies other than the euro.
3. Counterparties that are branches of credit institutions incorporated outside the EEA or Switzerland shall not be
entitled to mobilise as collateral the marketable assets laid down in this Article.
TITLE VIII
RULES FOR THE USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS
Article 138
Close links between counterparties and the issuer, debtor or guarantor of eligible assets
1. Irrespective of the fact that an asset is eligible, a counterparty shall not submit or use as collateral assets issued,
owed or guaranteed by itself or by any other entity with which it has close links.
2. ‘Close links’ means any of the following situations in which the counterparty and the other entity referred to in
paragraph 1 are linked:
(a) the counterparty owns directly, or indirectly through one or more other undertakings, 20 % or more of the capital
of that other entity;
(b) that other entity owns directly, or indirectly through one or more other undertakings, 20 % or more of the capital
of the counterparty;
(c) a third party owns, either directly or indirectly through one or more undertakings, 20 % or more of the capital of
the counterparty and 20 % or more of the capital of the other entity.
For the purposes of assessing the existence of close links in the case of multi-cédulas, the Eurosystem shall apply a
‘look-through approach’, i.e. it shall consider close links between each of the underlying cédulas issuers and the
counterparty.
3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply with respect to any of the following:
(a) close links between the counterparty and an EEA public sector entity that has the right to levy taxes, or cases where
a debt instrument is guaranteed by one or more EEA public sector entities that have the right to levy taxes and the
relevant guarantee complies with the features laid down in Article 114;
(b) covered bonds meeting the requirements set out in Article 129(1) to (3) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013;
(c) debt instruments protected by specific legal safeguards comparable to covered bonds meeting the requirements set
out in Article 129(1) to (3) and 129(6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Such specific legal safeguards shall require
a ring-fenced cover pool that ensures the satisfaction of bondholder claims in the event of insolvency of the issuer
from the ring-fenced cover pool. An assessment of the existence and comparability of legal safeguards, for which
the requirements set out under point (b) shall serve as a benchmark, shall be conducted by the Eurosystem on a
case-by-case basis and shall require an external legal opinion.
Examples of debt instruments protected by specific legal safeguards comparable to covered bonds referred to in
point (b) are:
(i) non-marketable RMBDs; and
(ii) multi-cédulas issued before the application date of this Guideline where the underlying cédulas comply with the
criteria set out in Article 129(1) to (3) and (6) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
L 91/66 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
Article 139
Use of guaranteed unsecured debt instruments issued by a counterparty or its closely linked entity
1. Unsecured debt instruments issued by a counterparty or any other entity closely linked to that counterparty, as
defined in Article 138, and fully guaranteed by one or several EEA public sector entities which have the right to levy
taxes shall not be mobilised as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations by that counterparty either:
(a) directly; or
(b) indirectly, where they are included in a pool of covered bonds,
2. In exceptional cases, the ECB's Governing Council may decide on temporary derogations from the restriction laid
down in paragraph 1 for a maximum of three years. A request for a derogation shall be accompanied by a funding plan
by the requesting counterparty that indicates the manner in which the mobilisation of the respective assets will be
phased out within three years following the granting of the derogation. Such a derogation shall only be provided where
the nature of the guarantee provided by one or several EEA central governments, regional governments, local authorities
or other public sector entities which have the right to levy taxes complies with the requirements for guarantees laid
down in Article 114.
Article 140
Close links with respect to asset-backed securities and currency hedges
A counterparty may not mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if the counterparty, or any entity with which it
has close links, as laid down in Article 138, provides a currency hedge to the asset-backed securities by entering into a
currency hedge transaction with the issuer as a hedge counterparty.
Article 141
Limits with respect to unsecured debt instruments issued by credit institutions and their closely linked entities
1. A counterparty shall not submit or use as collateral unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or by
any other entity with which that credit institution has close links to an extent that exceeds 5 % of the total value of the
assets used as collateral by that counterparty after the applicable haircut. This 5 % threshold shall not apply in either of
the following cases:
(a) if the value of such assets does not exceed EUR 50 million after any applicable haircut; or
(b) if such assets are guaranteed by a public sector entity which has the right to levy taxes by way of a guarantee that
complies with the features laid down in Article 114.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the establishment of a close link between two or more issuers of unsecured debt
instruments shall only be considered from one year after the date of the establishment of the close link.
3. For the purposes of this Article, ‘close links’ has the same meaning as laid down in Article 138.
Article 142
Liquidity support in respect of asset-backed securities
1. With effect from 1 November 2015, a counterparty may not mobilise as collateral any asset-backed securities if
the counterparty or any entity with which it has close links provides liquidity support as specified below. The
Eurosystem takes into account two forms of liquidity support for asset-backed securities: cash reserves and liquidity
facilities.
2. For liquidity support in the form of cash reserves, a counterparty shall not be permitted to mobilise as collateral
any asset-backed securities if the following three conditions are met simultaneously:
(a) the counterparty has close links with the issuer account bank in the asset-backed securities transaction;
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/67 
(b) the current amount of the reserve fund of the asset-backed securities transaction is greater than 5 % of the initial
outstanding amount of all senior and subordinated tranches of the asset-backed securities transaction;
(c) the current amount of the reserve fund of the asset-backed securities transaction is greater than 25 % of the current
outstanding amount of the subordinated tranches of the asset-backed securities transaction.
3. For liquidity support in the form of liquidity facilities, a counterparty shall not be permitted to mobilise as
collateral any asset-backed securities if the following two conditions are met simultaneously:
(a) the counterparty has close links with a liquidity facility provider; and
(b) the current amount of the liquidity facility of the asset-backed securities transaction is greater than 20 % of the
initial outstanding amount of all senior and subordinated tranches of the asset-backed securities transaction.
4. Close links in respect of this Article shall have the same meaning as laid down in Article 138(2).
Article 143
Transitional provisions regarding liquidity support in respect of asset-backed securities
1. Until Article 142 takes effect, the transitional provisions in this Article shall apply, as laid down in Article 191.
2. A counterparty may not mobilise asset-backed securities as collateral if the counterparty, or any entity with which
it has close links as defined in Article 138 provides liquidity support for 20 % or more of the outstanding amount of
the asset-backed security.
3. For the purposes of this Article, ‘liquidity support’ shall refer to any structural feature that can be used to cover
any temporary cash flow shortfalls that may occur during the lifetime of the transaction.
Article 144
Non-acceptance of eligible assets for operational reasons
Irrespective of the fact that an asset is eligible, an NCB may, for operational reasons, request the counterparty to remove
such asset before the occurrence of a cash flow, including payment of principal or coupons, as further defined in the
relevant national documentation.
Article 145
Notification, valuation and removal of assets that are ineligible or contravene the rules for the use of eligible
assets
1. If a counterparty has submitted or used assets that it is not or is no longer permitted to use as collateral, including
due to the identity of the issuer, debtor or guarantor, or the existence of close links, it shall immediately notify the home
NCB thereof.
2. The assets referred to in paragraph 1 shall be valued at zero on the next valuation date at the latest and a margin
call may be triggered.
3. A counterparty that has submitted or used any assets referred to in paragraph 1 shall remove such assets on the
earliest possible date.
4. A counterparty shall provide the Eurosystem with accurate and up-to-date information affecting the value of
collateral.
Article 146
Sanctions for non-compliance with the rules for the use of eligible assets
Non-compliance with the rules laid down in this Title shall be subject to sanctions, as applicable, in accordance with
Articles 154 to 157. Sanctions shall be applicable, regardless of whether a counterparty is actively participating in
monetary policy operations.
L 91/68 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
Article 147
Information sharing within the Eurosystem
For monetary policy implementation purposes, in particular to monitor compliance with the rules for the use of eligible
assets, the Eurosystem shall share information on capital holdings provided by the competent authority for such
purposes. The information shall be subject to the same secrecy standards as those applied by the competent authority.
TITLE IX
CROSS-BORDER USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS
Article 148
General principles
1. Counterparties may use eligible assets on a cross-border basis throughout the euro area for the handling of all
types of Eurosystem credit operations.
2. Counterparties may mobilise eligible assets other than fixed-term deposits, for cross-border use in accordance with
the following.
(a) Marketable assets shall be mobilised via: (i) eligible links (as described in Article 150) between EEA SSSs which have
been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework; (ii) the applicable procedures of
the CCBM; (iii) eligible links in combination with the CCBM; and
(b) Credit claims and RMBDs shall be mobilised in accordance with the applicable procedures of the CCBM as they
cannot be transferred through SSSs.
3. Marketable assets may be used through an NCB account in a SSS located in a country other than that of the NCB
in question if the Eurosystem has approved the use of such an account.
4. De Nederlandsche Bank shall be authorised to use its account with Euroclear Bank to settle collateral transactions
in the Eurobonds issued in that ICSD. The Central Bank of Ireland shall be authorised to open a similar account with
Euroclear Bank. This account can be used for all eligible assets held in Euroclear Bank, i.e. including eligible assets
transferred to Euroclear Bank through eligible links.
5. Counterparties shall execute the transfer of eligible assets via their securities settlement accounts with an SSS that
has been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework.
6. Counterparties without a safe custody account with an NCB or without a securities settlement account with an SSS
that has been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework may settle the transactions
through the securities settlement account or the safe custody account of a correspondent credit institution.
Article 149
CCBM
1. Under the CCBM, the cross-border relationship is between the NCBs. The NCBs acts as custodians (hereinafter the
‘correspondents’) for each other and for the ECB in respect of marketable assets accepted in their local depository, TPA
or settlement system. Specific procedures apply under the CCBM for credit claims and RMBDs. Details on the CCBM and
the applicable procedures are set out in Annex VI and in the brochure entitled ‘Correspondent central banking model
(CCBM) procedure for Eurosystem counterparties’, which is published on the ECB's website.
2. Assets deposited with a correspondent central bank shall only be used to collateralise Eurosystem credit
operations.
Article 150
Eligible links between SSSs
1. In addition to the CCBM, counterparties may use links that have been positively assessed pursuant to the
Eurosystem User Assessment Framework (hereinafter the ‘eligible links’) for the cross-border transfer of marketable
assets.
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/69 
2. Eligible links may only be established between SSSs that have been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem
User Assessment Framework and shall consist of a set of procedures and arrangements for the transfer of securities
through a book-entry process.
3. There shall be two types of eligible links which are established by contractual and technical agreements between
the SSSs involved:
(a) direct links established between two SSSs without involving an intermediary; and
(b) relayed links that allow two SSSs that are not directly connected to each other to exchange securities transactions or
transfers through a third SSS acting as the intermediary.
4. Only links that have been assessed and approved by the Eurosystem pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment
Framework shall be considered eligible. The ECB shall publish an up-to-date list of eligible links on its website.
5. Assets held through an eligible link may be used for Eurosystem credit operations, as well as for any other purpose
selected by the counterparty.
6. A table detailing the use of eligible links between SSSs is laid down in Annex VI.
Article 151
CCBM in combination with eligible links
1. Counterparties may use direct and relayed links referred to Article 150 in combination with the CCBM to mobilise
eligible marketable assets on a cross-border basis.
2. When using eligible links between SSSs in combination with the CCBM, counterparties shall hold the assets issued
in the issuer SSS in an account with an investor SSS directly or via a custodian. In the case of eligible relayed links, a
third SSS may act as an intermediary SSS.
3. Assets mobilised under paragraph 2 may be issued in a non-euro area EEA SSS that has been positively assessed
under the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework, provided that a link between the issuer SSS and the investor SSS has
been positively assessed pursuant to the Eurosystem User Assessment Framework.
4. A table detailing the use of CCBM in combination with eligible links is laid down in Annex VI.
Article 152
CCBM and tri-party collateral management services
1. Cross-border tri-party collateral management services shall allow a counterparty to increase or decrease the
amount of collateral which it mobilises with its home NCB, through recourse to collateral held with a TPA.
2. The CCBM (including the CCBM in combination with eligible links) may be used as a basis for the cross-border use
of tri-party collateral management services. Cross-border use of tri-party collateral management services shall involve a
NCB, where tri-party collateral management services are offered for cross-border Eurosystem use, acting as a
correspondent for NCBs whose counterparties have requested to use such tri-party collateral management services on a
cross-border basis for the purposes of Eurosystem credit operations. In order to facilitate cross-border use in accordance
with this paragraph, the relevant TPA shall need to be positively assessed by the Eurosystem.
3. A table detailing the use of CCBM with tri-party collateral management services is laid down in Annex VI.
L 91/70 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
PART FIVE
SANCTIONS IN THE EVENT OF A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COUNTERPARTY OBLIGATIONS
Article 153
Sanctions for non-compliance as regards minimum reserves
1. The ECB shall impose sanctions pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2532/98, Regulation (EC) No 2157/1999
(ECB/1999/4), Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 or Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9) on institutions which do
not comply with obligations arising from ECB regulations and decisions relating to the application of minimum
reserves. The relevant sanctions and procedural rules for their application are specified in those regulations.
2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, in the event of a serious infringement of the minimum reserve requirements,
the Eurosystem may suspend a counterparty's participation in open market operations.
Article 154
Sanctions for non-compliance with certain operational rules
1. In accordance with the provisions of the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by it, the NCB shall
impose one or more sanctions if a counterparty fails to comply with any of the following obligations:
(a) as regards reverse transactions and foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes, the obligations to
adequately collateralise and settle the amount the counterparty has been allotted over the whole term of a particular
operation; or the outstanding amount of a particular operation in the case of early termination executed by the NCB
over the remaining term of an operation, as laid down in Article 15;
(b) as regards collection of fixed-term deposits, outright transactions and the issuance of ECB debt certificates, the
obligation to settle the transaction, as laid down in Article 16;
(c) as regards the use of eligible assets, the obligation to mobilise or use only eligible assets and comply with the rules
for the use of eligible assets in Title VIII of Part Four;
(d) as regards end-of-day procedures and access conditions for the marginal lending facility, the obligation to present
sufficient eligible assets in advance as collateral in cases where there is any remaining negative balance on a counterparty's
settlement account in TARGET2 after finalisation of the end-of-day control procedures and an automatic
request for recourse to the marginal lending facility is therefore considered to arise, as laid down in Article 19(6).
2. A sanction imposed pursuant to this Article shall involve:
(a) a financial penalty only; or
(b) both a financial penalty and a non-financial penalty.
Article 155
Financial penalties for non-compliance with certain operational rules
If a counterparty fails to comply with any of the obligations referred to in Article 154(1), the Eurosystem shall impose a
financial penalty for each case of non-compliance. The applicable financial penalty shall be calculated in accordance with
Annex VII.
Article 156
Non-financial penalties for non-compliance with certain operational rules
1. If a counterparty fails to comply with an obligation referred to in either Article 154(1)(a) or (b) on more than
two occasions in a 12-month period and in respect of each failure:
(a) a financial penalty was applicable;
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/71 
(b) each decision to impose a financial penalty was notified to the counterparty;
(c) each occasion of non-compliance relates to the same type of non-compliance,
the Eurosystem shall suspend the counterparty on the occasion of the third failure and each such subsequent failure to
comply with an obligation of that same type in the relevant 12-month period. The 12-month period shall be calculated
from the date of the first failure to comply with an obligation referred to in either Article 154(1)(a) or (b), as applicable.
2. Any suspension imposed by the Eurosystem under paragraph 1 shall apply in respect of any subsequent open
market operation which is of the same type as the open market operation which resulted in a sanction under
paragraph 1.
3. The period of suspension imposed in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be determined in accordance with
Annex VII.
4. If a counterparty fails to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(c) on more than two occasions in
a 12-month period and in respect of each failure
(a) a financial penalty was applicable;
(b) each decision to impose a financial penalty was notified to the counterparty;
(c) each occasion of non-compliance relates to the same type of non-compliance,
the Eurosystem shall suspend the counterparty from the subsequent open market operation on the occasion of the
third failure and each such subsequent failure in the relevant 12-month period. The 12-month period shall be calculated
from the date of the first failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(c).
5. In exceptional cases, the Eurosystem may suspend a counterparty for a period of three months in respect of all
future Eurosystem monetary policy operations for any failure to comply with any of the obligations laid down in
Article 154(1). In such a case, the Eurosystem shall have regard to the seriousness of the case and, in particular, to the
amounts involved and to the frequency and duration of non-compliance.
6. The period of suspension imposed by the Eurosystem pursuant to this Article shall be applied in addition to the

PART SIX
DISCRETIONARY MEASURES
Article 158
Discretionary measures on the grounds of prudence or following an event of default
1. On the grounds of prudence, the Eurosystem may take any of the following measures:
(a) suspend, limit or exclude a counterparty's access to Eurosystem open market operations or standing facilities,
pursuant to any contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the home NCB or by the ECB;
(b) exempt a counterparty from minimum reserves requirements, pursuant to any contractual or regulatory
arrangements applied by the home NCB or by the ECB;
L 91/72 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
(c) reject, limit the use of or apply supplementary haircuts to assets mobilised as collateral in Eurosystem credit
operations by a specific counterparty on the basis of any information the Eurosystem considers relevant, in
particular if the credit quality of the counterparty appears to exhibit a high correlation with the credit quality of the
assets mobilised as collateral.
2. In the event that a discretionary measure as described in paragraph 1 is based on prudential information, the
Eurosystem shall use any such information, transmitted either by counterparties or by supervisors, in a manner strictly
commensurate with, and necessary for, the performance of the Eurosystem's tasks of conducting monetary policy.
3. In the case of an occurrence of an event of default, the Eurosystem may suspend, limit or exclude access to
Eurosystem open market operations or standing facilities with regard to counterparties that are in default pursuant to
any contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the Eurosystem.
4. All discretionary measures under paragraphs 1 and 3 shall be applied in a proportionate and non-discriminatory
manner and shall be duly justified by the Eurosystem.
Article 159
Discretionary measures relating to the Eurosystem's credit quality assessment
1. The Eurosystem shall determine whether an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fulfils the Eurosystem's credit quality
requirements on the basis of any information it considers relevant.
2. The Eurosystem may reject, limit the mobilisation or use of assets or apply supplementary haircuts on the grounds
provided for in paragraph 1, if such decision is required in order to ensure adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem.
3. In the event that a rejection as referred to in paragraph 2 is based on prudential information, the Eurosystem shall
use any such information, transmitted either by counterparties or by supervisors, in a manner that is strictly
commensurate with, and necessary for, the performance of the Eurosystem's tasks of conducting monetary policy.
4. The Eurosystem may exclude the following assets from the list of eligible marketable assets:
(a) assets issued or guaranteed by entities subject to freezing of funds and/or other measures imposed by the Union
under Article 75 of the Treaty or by a Member State restricting the use of funds; and/or

ANNEX I
MINIMUM RESERVES
The content of this Annex is for information purposes only. In the event of conflict between this Annex and the legal
framework for the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system as described in paragraph 1, the latter prevails.
1. Pursuant to Article 19 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank
(hereinafter the ‘Statue of the ESCB’), the European Central Bank (ECB) requires credit institutions to hold minimum
reserves on accounts with national central banks (NCBs) within the framework of the Eurosystem's minimum
reserve system. The legal framework for this system is laid down in Article 19 of the Statute of the ESCB,
Regulation (EC) No 2531/98 and Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9). The application of Regulation (EC)
No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9) ensures that the terms and conditions of the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system
are uniform throughout Member States whose currency is the euro.
2. The Eurosystem's minimum reserves system primarily pursues the aims of stabilising money market interest rates
and creating (or enlarging) a structural liquidity shortage.
3. In accordance with Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), the Eurosystem's minimum
reserve system applies to credit institutions established in Member States whose currency is the euro. In addition,
branches in the euro area of credit institutions not incorporated in the euro area are also subject to the
Eurosystem's minimum reserve system. However, branches established outside the euro area of credit institutions
incorporated in the euro area are not subject to this system.
4. Pursuant to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), institutions will be automatically exempt
from reserve requirements from the start of the maintenance period within which their authorisation is withdrawn
or surrendered, or within which a decision to submit the institution to winding-up proceedings is taken by a
judicial authority or any other competent authority of a Member State.
5. Pursuant to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), the ECB may exempt, on a non-discriminatory
basis, the institutions listed in points (a) to (c) thereof from reserve requirements. Such institutions include,
inter alia, institutions subject to reorganisation measures and institutions subject to the freezing of funds and/or
other measures imposed by the Union under Article 75 of the Treaty or by a Member State restricting the use of
their funds or a decision of the ECB's Governing Council suspending or excluding their access to open market
operations or the Eurosystem's standing facilities.
6. Pursuant to Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), the ECB establishes and maintains a list of
institutions subject to the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system.
7. The ECB also publishes a list of any institutions exempt from their obligations under this system for reasons other
than their being subject to reorganisation measures or the freezing of funds and/or other measures imposed by the
Union under Article 75 of the Treaty or by a Member State restricting the use of their funds or in respect of which
the ECB's Governing Council issued a decision suspending or excluding their access to open market operations or
the Eurosystem's standing facilities.
8. The reserve base of each institution is determined in relation to elements of its balance sheet. The balance sheet data
are reported to the NCBs within the general framework of the ECB's monetary and financial statistics. Institutions
calculate the reserve base in respect of a particular maintenance period on the basis of the data relating to the
month that is two months prior to the month within which the maintenance period starts pursuant to Article 3(3)
of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), subject to the exceptions for tail institutions, as laid down in
Article 3(4) of the same Regulation.
9. The reserve ratios are determined by the ECB subject to the maximum limit specified in Regulation (EC)
No 2531/98.
10. The amount of minimum reserves to be held by each institution in respect of a particular maintenance period are
calculated by applying the reserve ratios to each relevant item of the reserve base for that period. The minimum
reserves identified by the relevant participating NCB and by the institution in accordance with the procedures
mentioned in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9) constitute the basis for: (a) remuneration of
holdings of required reserves; and (b) assessment of an institution's compliance with the obligation to hold the
required amount of minimum reserves.

11. In order to pursue the aim of stabilising interest rates, the Eurosystem's minimum reserve system enables
institutions to make use of averaging provisions, implying that compliance with reserve requirements is determined
on the basis of the average of the end-of-calendar-day balances on the counterparties' reserve accounts over a
maintenance period. Compliance with the reserve requirement is determined on the basis of an institution's average
daily reserve holdings over the maintenance period. The maintenance period is defined in Article 7 of Regulation
(EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9).
12. In accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), institutions' holdings of required
reserves are remunerated at the average, over the maintenance period, of the ECB's rate (weighted according to the
number of calendar days) on the main refinancing operations according to the following formula (whereby the
result is rounded to the nearest cent):
Rt ¼ Ht � nt � rt
100 � 360
rt ¼ Xnt
i¼1
MRi
nt
Where:
Rt = remuneration to be paid on holdings of required reserves for the maintenance period t;
Ht = average daily holdings of required reserves for the maintenance period t;
nt = number of calendar days in the maintenance period t;
rt = rate of remuneration on holdings of required reserves for the maintenance period t. Standard rounding of the
rate of remuneration to two decimals shall be applied;
i = ith calendar day of the maintenance period t;
MRi = marginal interest rate for the most recent main refinancing operation settled on or before calendar day i.
Where an institution fails to comply with other obligations under ECB regulations and decisions relating to the
Eurosystem's minimum reserve system (e.g. if relevant data are not transmitted in time or are not accurate), the ECB is
empowered to impose sanctions in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2532/98 and Regulation (EC) No 2157/1999
(ECB/1999/4). The ECB's Executive Board may specify and publish the criteria according to which it will apply the
sanctions provided for in Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2531/98.

ANNEX V
CRITERIA FOR THE SELECTION OF COUNTERPARTIES TO PARTICIPATE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE
INTERVENTION OPERATIONS
1. The selection of counterparties for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations is based on two sets of
criteria relating to the principles of prudence and efficiency.
2. The criteria relating to efficiency are only applied once the criteria relating to the principle of prudence have been
applied.
3. The criteria relating to the principle of prudence comprise the following:
(a) creditworthiness of the counterparty, which is assessed using a combination of different methods, e.g. using
credit ratings available from commercial agencies and the in-house analysis of capital and other business ratios;
(b) a counterparty is supervised by a recognised supervisor;
(c) a counterparty has a good reputation and observes high ethical standards.
4. The criteria relating to the principle of efficiency comprise, inter alia, the following:
(a) a counterparty's competitive pricing behaviour and its ability to conduct large-volume foreign exchange
operations efficiently under all market conditions; and
(b) the quality and coverage of information provided by the counterparty.
5. In order to be able to intervene efficiently in different geographical locations, the national central banks may select
counterparties for their foreign exchange intervention operations in any international financial centre.
L 91/90 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
ANNEX VI
CROSS-BORDER USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS
I. THE CORRESPONDENT CENTRAL BANKING MODEL (CCBM)
Table 1
The correspondent central banking model (CCBM)
Use of eligible assets deposited in country B by a counterparty established in country A in order to obtain credit
from the national central bank (NCB) of country A
1. All NCBs maintain securities accounts with each other for the cross-border use of eligible assets. The precise
procedure of the CCBM depends on whether the eligible assets are earmarked for each individual transaction or
whether they are held in a pool of underlying assets.
2. In an earmarking system, as soon as a counterparty's bid for credit is accepted by its home NCB the counterparty
instructs, via its own custodian if necessary, the securities settlement systems (SSS) in the country in which its
marketable assets are held, to transfer them to the central bank of that country (hereinafter the ‘correspondent
central bank’) for the account of the home NCB. Once the home NCB has been informed by the correspondent
central bank that the collateral has been received, it transfers the funds to the counterparty. The NCBs do not
advance funds until they are certain that the counterparties' marketable assets have been received by the
correspondent central bank. Where necessary to meet settlement deadlines, counterparties may be able to predeposit
assets with correspondent central banks for the account of their home NCB using the CCBM procedures.
3. In a pooling system, the counterparty may at any time provide the correspondent central bank with marketable
assets for the account of the home NCB. Once the home NCB has been informed by the correspondent central bank
that the marketable assets have been received, it will add these marketable assets to the pool account of the
counterparty.
4. Specific procedures for cross-border use have been developed for certain non-marketable assets, i.e. credit claims and
retail mortgage-backed debt instruments (RMBDs). When credit claims are used as collateral in a cross-border
context, a CCBM variant is applied to credit claims, using a transfer of ownership, an assignment or a pledge in
favour of the home NCB, or a charge in favour of the correspondent central bank, acting as the agent for the home
NCB. A further ad-hoc variant based on the charge in favour of the correspondent central bank acting as the agent
for the home NCB is applied to allow the cross-border use of RMBDs.
5. The CCBM is available to counterparties, both for marketable and non-marketable assets, as a minimum from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. CET on each TARGET2 business day. A counterparty wishing to make use of the CCBM must advise the
NCB from which it wishes to receive credit, i.e. its home NCB, before 4 p.m. CET. The counterparty
2.4.2015 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 91/91 
must ensure that the collateral for securing the credit operation is delivered to the account of the correspondent
central bank by 4.45 p.m. CET at the latest. Instructions or deliveries that do not respect this deadline will only be
dealt with on a best effort basis and may be considered for credit that will be given on the following TARGET2
business day. When counterparties foresee a need to use the CCBM late in the day, they should, where possible, predeposit
the assets. Under exceptional circumstances or when required for monetary policy purposes, the ECB may
decide to extend the CCBM's closing time until the TARGET2 closing time, in cooperation with central securities
depositories regarding their availability to extend their cut-off times for marketable assets.
II. ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN SSSS
Table 2
Links between securities settlement systems
Use of eligible assets issued in the SSS of country B held by a counterparty established in country A through a link
between the SSSs in countries A and B in order to obtain credit from the NCB of country A.
1. Eligible links between two SSSs in the European Economic Area (EEA) consist of a set of procedures and
arrangements for the cross-border transfer of securities through a book-entry process. They take the form of an
omnibus account opened by an SSS (hereinafter the ‘investor SSS’) in another SSS (hereinafter the ‘issuer SSS’).
2. Eligible links allow a participant in one SSS in the EEA to hold securities issued in another SSS in the EEA without
being a participant therein. When using links between SSSs, the counterparties hold the assets on their own account
with their home SSS and have no need for a custodian.
III. CCBM IN COMBINATION WITH ELIGIBLE LINKS
Table 3
CCBM in combination with eligible links
Use of eligible assets issued in the SSS of country C and held in the SSS of country B by a counterparty established
in country A through a direct link between the SSSs in countries B and C in order to obtain credit from the NCB of
country A.
L 91/92 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
Where eligible assets in the form of securities are to be transferred via the CCBM with links, counterparties must
ensure that the securities are delivered to an account at the relevant investor SSS by 4 p.m. CET on the settlement
date in order to ensure settlement of same-day value operations. Any request for mobilisation received by home
NCBs from their counterparties after 4 p.m. CET, or any request for the delivery of eligible assets to an account at
the relevant investor SSS after 4 p.m. CET, is dealt with on a best efforts basis, according to the cut-off times of the
SSSs involved.
IV. CCBM WITH TRI-PARTY COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES
Table 4
Cross-border tri-party services
Use of eligible assets held in the tri-party agent (TPA) of country B by a counterparty established in country A in
order to obtain credit from the NCB of country A.
The arrow ‘Information on collateral’ between counterparty A and NCB A may not be relevant in the case of certain
TPAs, depending on the contractual model chosen, and in such cases the counterparty does not send an instruction
to NCB A or receive a confirmation from NCB A.

ANNEX VII
CALCULATION OF SANCTIONS TO BE APPLIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PART FIVE
I. CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL PENALTIES FOR BREACH OF CERTAIN COUNTERPARTY OBLIGATIONS
1. Where a financial penalty is to be imposed by a national central bank(NCB) on any of its counterparties in
accordance with Part Five, the NCB shall calculate the penalty in accordance with a pre-specified penalty rate, as
follows.
(a) For failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(a), (b) or (c) a financial penalty is
calculated using the marginal lending facility rate that applied on the day when the non-compliance began plus
2,5 percentage points.
(b) For failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(d), a financial penalty is calculated using
the marginal lending facility rate that applied on the day when the non-compliance began plus 5 percentage
points. For repeated infringements of the obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(d) within a 12-month period,
taken into account from the day of the first infringement, the penalty rate increases by a further 2,5 percentage
points for each infringement.
2. For failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(a) or (b), a financial penalty is calculated by
applying the penalty rate, in accordance with paragraph 1(a), to the amount of collateral or cash that the
counterparty could not deliver or settle, multiplied by the coefficient X/360, where X is the number of calendar
days, with a maximum of seven, during which the counterparty was unable to collateralise or settle: (a) the allotted
amount as specified in the certification of individual tender allotment results during the maturity of an operation;
or (b) the remaining amount of a particular operation if there are early terminations executed by the NCB over the
remainder of the term of the operation.
3. For failure to comply with an obligation referred to in Article 154(1)(c), a financial penalty is calculated by applying
the penalty rate, in accordance with paragraph 1(a), to the value of the ineligible assets or the assets that may not
be mobilised or used by the counterparty after haircuts, as follows:
(a) in the case of ineligible assets which are provided by the counterparty to an NCB, the value of the ineligible
assets after haircuts are taken into account; or
(b) in the case of assets which were originally eligible but became ineligible or may no longer be mobilised or used
by the counterparty, the value after haircuts of the assets that have not been removed by or before the start of
the eighth calendar day, following an event after which the eligible assets became ineligible or may no longer be
mobilised or used by the counterparty, are taken into account.
4. The amounts referred to in paragraph 3(a) and (b) are multiplied by the coefficient X/360, where X is the number
of calendar days, with a maximum of seven, during which the counterparty failed to comply with its obligations in
respect of the use of assets submitted as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations. In the case of paragraph 3(b),
the calculation of X begins after the expiry of the grace period of seven calendar days.
[EUR [value of ineligible assets after haircuts on the first day of the infringement] * (the applicable marginal lending facility
rate on the day when the infringement began + 2,5 %) * [X]/360 = EUR […]]
5. For limit breaches as regards unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or its closely linked entities
as laid down in Article 141, the application of a grace period is determined as follows:
(a) A grace period of seven calendar days applies if the breach resulted from a change in the valuation, without a
submission of additional such unsecured debt instruments, on the basis of the following:
(i) the value of those already submitted unsecured debt instruments has increased; or
(ii) the total collateral pool has been lowered.
In such cases the counterparty is required to adjust the value of its total collateral pool or the value of such
unsecured debt instruments within the grace period, to ensure compliance with the applicable limit.
(b) The submission of additional unsecured debt instruments issued by a credit institution or its closely linked
entities breaching the applicable limit does not entitle the counterparty to a grace period.
L 91/94 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
6. If the counterparty has provided information that affects the value of its collateral negatively from the Eurosystem's
perspective with regard to Article 145(4), e.g. incorrect information on the outstanding amount of a used credit
claim that is or has been false or out of date, the amount (value) of the collateral that has been negatively affected is
taken into account for the calculation of the financial penalty under paragraph 3. If the incorrect information is
corrected within the grace period, no penalty is to be applied.
7. For failure to comply with the obligations referred to in Article 154(1)(d), a financial penalty is calculated by
applying the penalty rate, in accordance with paragraph 1(b), to the amount of the counterparty's unauthorised
access to the marginal lending facility.
8. An NCB will impose a minimum financial penalty of EUR 500 where the calculation in accordance with this Annex
results in an amount of less than EUR 500. A financial penalty will not be imposed where a breach is rectified
within an applicable grace period.
II. CALCULATION OF NON-FINANCIAL PENALTIES IN CASE OF BREACH OF CERTAIN COUNTERPARTY OBLIGATIONS
Suspension for non-compliance with obligations referred to in Article 154(1)(a) or (b)
9. Where a suspension period applies in accordance with Article 156(1), an NCB will impose the suspension in
accordance with the following:
(a) if the amount of non-delivered collateral or cash is up to 40 % of the total collateral or cash to be delivered, a
suspension of one month applies;
(b) if the amount of non-delivered collateral or cash is between 40 % and 80 % of the total collateral or cash to be
delivered, a suspension of two months applies;
(c) if the amount of non-delivered collateral or cash is between 80 % and 100 % of the total collateral or cash to be
delivered, a suspension of three months applies.
10. With regard to I and II above, if a sanction relates to a transaction between a counterparty and the ECB in a
bilateral procedure, the above provisions are interpreted to cater for the imposition of sanctions by the ECB.

ANNEX VIII
LOAN-LEVEL DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES
This Annex applies to the provision of comprehensive and standardised loan-level data on the pool of cash-flow
generating assets backing the asset-backed securities (ABSs), as specified in Article 78.
I. SUBMISSION OF LOAN-LEVEL DATA
1. Loan-level data must be submitted by the relevant parties to a loan-level data repository designated by the
Eurosystem. The loan-level data repository publishes such data electronically. In order to be designated, loan-level
data repositories must comply with the applicable Eurosystem requirements, including open access, coverage, nondiscrimination,
appropriate governance structure and transparency.
2. Loan-level data must be submitted for each individual transaction together with the up-to-date relevant loan-level
data reporting template, published on the ECB's website, depending on the type of asset backing the ABS, as defined
in Article 73(1).
3. Loan-level data must be reported at least on a quarterly basis, but no later than one month following a due date for
the payment of interest on the relevant ABSs. As regards the data submitted, the pool cut-off date may not be more
than two months old, i.e. the ‘date of submission of report’ less the ‘pool cut-off date’ must be less than two months.
The ‘pool cut-off date’ is defined as the date on which a snapshot of the performance of the underlying assets was
captured for the respective report.
4. To ensure compliance with the requirements in paragraphs 2 and 3, the loan-level data repository conducts
automated consistency and accuracy checks on reports of new and updated loan-level data for each transaction.
II. LEVEL OF REQUIRED DETAIL
1. After the date of application of loan-level data reporting requirements for the specific class of cash-flow generating
assets backing the ABSs as specified on the European Central Bank's (ECB's) website, detailed loan-by-loan level
information must be provided for ABSs to become or remain eligible.
2. Within a period of three months, the ABSs must achieve a compulsory minimum compliance level, assessed by
reference to the availability of information, in particular the data fields of the loan-level data reporting template.
3. To capture non-available fields, a set of six ‘no data’ (ND) options are included in the loan-level data templates and
must be filled in whenever particular data cannot be submitted in accordance with the loan-level data template. There
is also a seventh ND option, which only applies for the loan-level data template for commercial mortgage-backed
securities (CMBSs).
Table 1
Explanation of the ND options
‘no data’ options Explanation
ND1 Data not collected as not required by the underwriting criteria
ND2 Data collected on application but not loaded into the reporting system on completion
ND3 Data collected on application but loaded it on a separate system from the reporting one
ND4 Data collected but will only be available from YYYY-MM
ND5 Not relevant
ND6 Not applicable for the jurisdiction
ND7 Only for CMBS loans with a value below EUR 500 000, i.e. the value of the whole commercial
loan balance at origination
L 91/96 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
III. TRANSITIONAL PERIOD
1. The following nine-month transitional period applies to all ABSs, depending on the date on which the loan-level data
reporting requirements apply for the relevant asset class backing the ABSs:
(a) during the first three months (first quarter) following the date of application, loan-level data must be reported,
but there are no specific limits regarding the number of mandatory fields containing ND1 to ND7;
(b) from the beginning of the fourth month to the end of the sixth month (second quarter), the number of
mandatory fields that contain ND1 may not exceed 30 % of the total number of mandatory fields and the
number of mandatory fields which contain ND2, ND3 or ND4 may not exceed 40 % of the total number of
mandatory fields;
(c) from the beginning of the seventh month to the end of the ninth month (third quarter) the number of
mandatory fields that contain ND1 may not exceed 10 % of the total number of mandatory fields and the
number of mandatory fields which contain ND2, ND3 or ND4 may not exceed 20 % of the total number of
mandatory fields;
(d) at the end of the nine-month transitional period, there must be no mandatory fields in the loan-level data
containing ND1, ND2, ND3 or ND4 values for an individual transaction.
2. Applying these thresholds, the loan-level data repository generates and assigns a score to each ABS transaction upon
submission and processing of loan-level data.
3. This score reflects the number of mandatory fields that contain ND1 and the number of mandatory fields that
contain ND2, ND3 or ND4, compared in each case against the total number of mandatory fields. In this regard, the
options ND5, ND6 and ND7 may only be used if the relevant data fields in the relevant loan-level data reporting
template so permit. Combining the two threshold references produces the following range of loan-level data scores.

ANNEX IX
EUROSYSTEM CREDIT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK PERFORMANCE MONITORING PROCESS
1. For each credit assessment system, the Eurosystem credit assessment framework (ECAF) performance monitoring
process consists of an annual ex post comparison of:
(a) the observed default rates for all eligible entities and debt instruments rated by the credit assessment system,
whereby these entities and instruments are grouped into static pools based on certain characteristics, e.g. credit
rating, asset class, industry sector, credit quality assessment model; and
(b) the maximum probability of default associated with the respective credit quality step of the Eurosystem's
harmonised rating scale.
2. The first element of the process is the annual compilation by the credit assessment system provider of the list of
entities and debt instruments with credit quality assessments that satisfy the Eurosystem credit quality requirements
at the beginning of the monitoring period. This list must then be submitted by the credit assessment system provider
to the Eurosystem, using the template provided by the Eurosystem, which includes identification, classification and
credit quality assessment-related fields.
3. The second element of the process takes place at the end of the 12-month monitoring period. The credit assessment
system provider updates the performance data for the entities and debt instruments on the list. The Eurosystem
reserves the right to request any additional information required in order to conduct performance monitoring.
4. The observed default rate of the static pools of a credit assessment system recorded over a one-year horizon is input
to the ECAF performance monitoring process, which comprises an annual rule and a multi-period assessment.
5. In the event of a significant deviation between the observed default rate of the static pools and the maximum
probability of default of the relevant credit quality step over an annual and/or a multi-annual period, the Eurosystem
will consult the credit assessment system provider to analyse the reasons for that deviation.

SECURITY FORMS
On 13 June 2006 the European Central Bank (ECB) announced the new global notes (NGN) criteria for international
global bearer form securities that would be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations from 1 January 2007.
On 22 October 2008 the ECB announced that international debt securities in global registered form issued after
30 September 2010, would only be eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations when the new safekeeping
structure for international debt securities (NSS) is used.
The following table summarises the eligibility rules for the different forms of securities with the introduction of the
NGN criteria.

VI. EXAMPLE 6: RISK CONTROL MEASURES
1. This example illustrates the risk control framework applied to assets mobilised as collateral in the Eurosystem credit
operations. It is based on the assumption that, in the calculation of the need for a margin call, accrued interest on
the liquidity provided is taken into account and a trigger point of 0,5 % of the liquidity provided is applied. The
example is based on the assumption that a counterparty participates in the following Eurosystem monetary policy
operations:
(a) a main refinancing operation starting on 30 July 2014 and ending on 6 August 2014 where the counterparty is
allotted EUR 50 million at an interest rate of 0,15 %;
(b) a longer-term refinancing operation starting on 31 July 2014 and ending on 23 October 2014 where the
counterparty is allotted EUR 45 million at an interest rate of 0,15 %;
(c) a main refinancing operation starting on 6 August 2014 and ending on 13 August 2014 where the
counterparty is allotted EUR 35 million at an interest rate of 0,15 %.

(*) The prices shown for a specific valuation date correspond to the most representative price on the business day preceding this

EARMARKING SYSTEM
First, it is assumed that the transactions are carried out with a national central bank (NCB) using a system where
underlying assets are earmarked for each transaction. The valuation of assets mobilised as collateral is carried out on a
daily basis. The risk control framework can then be described as follows (see also Table 2 below):
1. On 30 July 2014, the counterparty enters into a repurchase transaction with the NCB, which purchases
EUR 50,6 million of Asset A. Asset A is a jumbo covered bond with a fixed coupon maturing on 30 August 2018
and allocated to credit quality step 1-2. It thus has a residual maturity of four years, therefore requiring a valuation
haircut of 2,5 %. The market price of Asset A on its reference market on that day is 101,61 %, which includes the
accrued interest on the coupon. The counterparty is required to provide an amount of Asset A, which, after
deduction of the 2,5 % valuation haircut, exceeds the allotted amount of EUR 50 million. The counterparty
therefore delivers Asset A for a nominal amount of EUR 50,6 million, the adjusted market value of which is
EUR 50 129 294 on that day.
2. On 31 July 2014, the counterparty enters into a repurchase transaction with the NCB, which purchases
EUR 21 million of Asset A (market price 101,21 %, valuation haircut 2,5 %) and EUR 25 million of Asset B (market
price 98,02 %). Asset B is a central government bond with variable rate coupon payments and allocated to credit
quality step 1-2, to which a 0,5 % valuation haircut is applied. The adjusted market value of Asset A and Asset B on
that day is EUR 45 130 098, thus exceeding the required amount of EUR 45 000 000.
3. On 31 July 2014, the assets underlying the main refinancing operation initiated on 30 July 2014 are revalued. With
a market price of 101,21 %, the haircut-adjusted market value of Asset A is still within the lower and upper trigger
amounts. The collateral that was mobilised initially is consequently considered to cater for both the initial amount of
liquidity provided and the accrued interest amounting to EUR 208.
L 91/108 EN Official Journal of the European Union 2.4.2015 
4. On 1 August 2014, the underlying assets are revalued: the market price of Asset A is 99,50 % and the market price
of Asset B is 97,95 %. Accrued interest amounts to EUR 417 on the main refinancing operation initiated on 30 July
2014 and EUR 188 on the longer-term refinancing operation initiated on 31 July 2014. As a result, the adjusted
market value of Asset A in the first transaction falls below the transaction's amount to be covered, i.e. the liquidity
provided plus the accrued interest, by EUR 912 092, but also below the lower trigger level of EUR 49 750 415. The
counterparty delivers EUR 950 000 of Asset A in nominal value terms, which, after deducting a 2,5 % haircut from
the market value based on a price of 99,50 %, restores sufficient collateral coverage. NCBs may perform margin calls
in cash rather than securities.
A margin call is also needed on the second transaction since the adjusted market value of the underlying assets used
in this transaction (EUR 44 737 688) is below the lower trigger level (EUR 44 775 187). The counterparty
therefore provides EUR 270 000 of Asset B with an adjusted market value of EUR 263 143.
5. On 4 and 5 August 2014, the underlying assets are revalued, without resulting in any margin call for the
transactions entered into on 30 and 31 July 2014.
6. On 6 August 2014, the counterparty repays the liquidity provided under the main refinancing operation initiated on
30 July 2014, including the accrued interest of EUR 1 458. The NCB returns EUR 51 550 000 of Asset A in
nominal value.
On the same day the counterparty enters into a new repurchase transaction with the NCB, which purchases
EUR 75 million of Asset C in nominal value terms. Since Asset C is a zero coupon corporate bond with a residual
maturity of more than 10 years and allocated to credit quality step 1-2, requiring a valuation haircut of 13 %, the
corresponding haircut-adjusted market value on that day is of EUR 35 045 775. The revaluation of assets
underlying the long-term refinancing operation initiated on 31 July 2014 reveals that the adjusted market value of
the assets provided exceeds the upper trigger level and leads to the NCB returning EUR 262 000 of Asset B in
nominal value to the counterparty. If a margin had to be paid to the counterparty by the NCB in relation to the
second transaction, such a margin could, in certain cases, be netted out with the margin paid to the NCB by the
counterparty in relation to the first transaction. As a result, there would only be one margin settlement.
POOLING SYSTEM
Second, it is assumed that the transactions are carried out with an NCB using a pooling system where assets included in
the pool of assets used by the counterparty are not earmarked for specific transactions:
1. The same sequence of transactions is used in this example as in the above example illustrating an earmarking
system. The main difference is that, on the revaluation dates, the adjusted market value of all the assets in the pool
has to cover the total amount of all of the counterparty's outstanding operations with the NCB. The margin call of
EUR 1 174 592 occurring on 1 August 2014 is identical in this example to the one required in the earmarking
system case. The counterparty delivers EUR 1 300 000 of Asset A in nominal value terms, which, after deducting a
2,5 % haircut from the market value based on a price of 99,50 %, restores sufficient collateral coverage.
2. Moreover, on 6 August 2014, when the main refinancing operation entered into on 30 July 2014 matures, the
counterparty may keep the assets on its pool account. An asset can also be exchanged for another asset as shown in
the example, where EUR 51,9 million of Asset A in nominal value are replaced with EUR 75,5 million of Asset C in
nominal value to cover the liquidity provided and the accrued interest under all refinancing operations.
3. The risk control framework in the pooling system is described in Table 3.

(*) In a pooling system, the lower trigger amount is the lowest threshold for margin calls. In practice most NCBs require additional collateral whenever the haircut adjusted market value of the collateral pool
falls below the total amount to be covered.
(**) In a pooling system, the notion of upper trigger amount is not relevant, since the counterparty will constantly target an excess amount of collateral provided in order to minimise operational transactions.
